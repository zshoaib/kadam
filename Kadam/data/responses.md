Name-brand vitamins are more likely to be safe and to have been safely used by other women. Vitamins should have 100% daily value (or DV). Moreover, it is highly recommended to take folate, iron, vitamin D, and calicum supplement to prevent fatal defects while other vitamins can be supplemented through a healthy diet.

## miscarriage signs
* miscarriage/signs
- The most common sign of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding, which can vary from light red or brown spotting to heavy bleeding. If it is very early in the pregnancy, you may think that you have your period. Other signs may include cramping pain in your lower tummy, which can vary from period-like pain to strong labour-like contractions, passing fluid from your vagina, and passing of blood clots or pregnancy tissue from your vagina.

## miscarriage what to do
* miscarriage/what_to_do
- If you are concerned that you are having a miscarriage, call your doctor or midwife for advice and support. Keep in mind that many women experience vaginal spotting in the first trimester of pregnancy that does not result in a miscarriage. If you are alone, consider calling your partner or a friend for help and support. If you are at home or away from your doctor- use pads to manage the bleeding, take medications such as paracetamol if you have pain, rest, and call your doctor or midwife.

## miscarriage what is it
* miscarriage/what_is_it
- A miscarriage is the loss of your baby before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The loss of a baby after 20 weeks is called a stillbirth. There are several types of miscarriage – threatened, inevitable, complete, incomplete or missed.

## miscarriage causes
* miscarriage/causes
- Many women wonder if their miscarriage was their fault. In most cases, a miscarriage has nothing to do with anything you have or have not done. There is no evidence that exercising, stress, working or having sex causes a miscarriage. Most parents do not ever find out the exact cause. However, it is known that miscarriages often happen because the baby fails to develop properly, usually due to a chromosomal abnormality that was spontaneous, not inherited. Ocassionally miscarriage is caused by hormonal abnormalities, immune system and blood clotting problems, medical conditions such as thyroid problems or diabetes, severe infections causing high fevers (not common colds), and physical problems with your womb or cervix.

## miscarriage future
* miscarriage/future
- Most women who have had a miscarriage will go on to have a successful pregnancy. If you have had one miscarriage, the chance of you miscarrying again stays at 1 in 5 pregnancies. If you have had recurrent miscarriages (3 or more in a row), your doctor may suggest testing to try and find a specific cause.

## miscarriage risk factor
* miscarriage/risk
- Women are more likely to have miscarriages if they are older, smoke, drink alcohol in the first trimester, drink too much caffeine in coffee, tea or energy drinks, and have had several previous miscarriages.

## abdominal sepration signs
* abdominalsep/signs
- If you have abdominal separation after the birth of your baby, you may be able to see a gap between the two bands of abdominal muscles. You can see this gap more clearly if you lie flat on your back and lift your head up. You might also notice a physical bulge in the middle of your stomach, especially when your abdominal muscles are active. Some women with abdominal separation also get lower back pain, as the separation prevents the stomach muscles from supporting the back.

## abdominal sepration disappear
* abdominalsep/leave
- Abdominal separation usually goes away after the birth of the baby. That said, up to 1 in 3 women still report problems with abdominal separation 12 months after the birth.

## abdominal sepration prevention
* abdominalsep/prevention
- Strengthening your core muscles before you get pregnant or in the early stages of pregnancy might help prevent abdominal separation. It’s best to avoid putting excess strain on your abdominal muscles while pregnant. Avoid sit-ups or planks. Try to avoid constipation and if you have a cough, get it treated.

## abdominal sepration treatment
* abdominalsep/treatment
- It’s important to stop the separation from getting worse. Try these tips- Avoid lifting anything heavier than your baby. Roll onto your side when getting out of bed or sitting up. Choose gentle exercises (rather than intense ones) that strengthen the deeper stomach muscles. Skip activities and movements that can make abdominal separation worse, such as sit-ups (crunches), oblique curls and some yoga poses (ask your yoga teacher for advice). You can also wear a supportive brace or compression underwear to help support your back and resolve the muscle separation.

## abdominal sepration what
* abdominalsep/what
 	 - Abdominal separation(diastasis recti) occurs when the growing uterus causes the 2 long, parallel muscles of your stomach to separate from each other. These muscles run from your chest to your pelvis, just under the skin, down the middle of your belly. Abdominal separation is partly due to the pressure of your growing baby, and partly due to the hormonal changes that take place during pregnancy. It usually starts in the second half of pregnancy.

## aminocentesis what
* amniocentesis/what
	- An amniocentesis is a procedure that allows a small amount of the fluid around the developing baby (amniotic fluid) to be collected. This fluid contains cells from the baby that can be tested for some types of birth defects. The most common type of test done on an amniocentesis sample is a chromosome test. In some cases, test for infections, spina bifida or other genetic conditions may be done.

## aminocentesis risk
* amniocentesis/risk
	- Some women experience cramping on the day of the test. 1 or 2 women out of every 100 women who have an amniocentesis experience bruising, some spotting or leakage of amniotic fluid after the procedure. This usually settles within 24 hours but should be reported to your doctor if it occurs. It is estimated that about 1 woman in every 200 women will miscarry as a result of having an amniocentesis. In other words 0.5% of all the women who have this test will miscarry.

## aminocentesis why
* amniocentesis/why
	- An amniocentesis may be offered when there is an increased risk that the baby may have a chromosome problem or other type of birth defect. Some of the most common reasons include- If the woman will be older than 35 at the time of delivery of the baby. If an increased risk of a chromosome problem is identified on a screening test, such as first trimester screening. If an ultrasound detects unexpected abnormalities in the baby. If the parents have had a previous baby with chromosome problem, or a parent has a variation of the chromosomes that increases the chance of the baby having a chromosome problem. If there is an increased risk that the baby may have a particular genetic disorder, for which a test is available. If there is concern that the baby may have been exposed to some types of infections.

## aminocentesis when
* amniocentesis/when
- An amniocentesis is usually done around 15-18 weeks of pregnancy. It can be done later if there is a specific reason.

## aminocentesis alternative
* amniocentesis/alternatives
- Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is another test that allows a baby’s chromosomes to be tested accurately. This test can be done earlier in pregnancy (10-11 weeks). It is usual to choose either a CVS or an amniocentesis, not both. 

## anemia what
* anemia/what
- When you have anaemia, your blood doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen around your body and to your baby.

## anemia red blood cells
* anemia/red_blood
- Red blood cells are cells in your blood. Their main role is to carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body – your brain, your muscles, your skin, your kidneys and all else. Red blood cells are produced in bone marrow. They contain a protein known as haemoglobin, which is vital for carrying oxygen.

## anemia why
* anemia/why
- Iron, vitamin B12 and folate are needed to produce the haemoglobin in red blood cells.  With making extra blood in pregnancy, the body needs increased supplies of these to keep up. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy.  Your iron requirements are three times higher in pregnancy than when you are menstruating, and your iron needs increase throughout the pregnancy.

## anemia risks
* anemia/risk
- Anaemia not only makes you feel more tired and breathless, it can increase the likelihood of you needing a blood transfusion after your baby is born. It may also increase the risk of your baby being born early or at a low birth weight, and of your baby being anaemic after birth.

## anemia prevention
* anemia/prevention
- There are 3 good ways to avoid becoming anaemic while pregnant: start your pregnancy in good health, eat well while pregnant, and take iron supplements if needed. Eating a healthy diet protects against anaemia. Iron is found in meats, iron fortified breads and cereals, eggs, spinach and dried fruit. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, shellfish, eggs and dairy products. High levels of folate are found in green leafy vegetables, beans, muesli, broccoli, beef, Brussels sprouts and asparagus Eating a diet rich in these foods will help prevent anaemia.

## morphology scan what
* morphology/what
- The morphology scan is a detailed ultrasound scan that looks at your baby’s body and observes the position of the placenta, the umbilical cord, the amniotic fluid around your baby, and your uterus and your cervix. It is also known as a ‘anomaly scan’ or a ‘18-20 week scan’.

## morphology scan when
* morphology/when
- An morphology scan is performed in the second trimester, usually at around 18-22 weeks of pregnancy.

## morphology scan how
* morphology/how
- The sonographer will place some gel on your belly and move a transducer across it in order to obtain images of your baby on a screen. The scan takes about half an hour. You might be offered a photo or a DVD of the scan.

## apgar what
* apgar/what
- The Apgar score is a measure of a baby’s condition after birth. The Apgar score checks 5 characteristics of your baby. These are: skin colour, heart rate, reflexes and responsiveness, muscle tone, and breathing rate. Each characteristic is rated from 0 to 2, with 2 being the best score. The total gives an Apgar score out of 10 for your baby.

## apgar mean
* apgar/mean
- A score of 7 or more is normal. A score of 6 or less at 1 minute and a score of 7 or more at 5 minutes is also normal. However, a score below 7 in the second test at 5 minutes is considered low. If your baby’s score was low in the first Apgar test and hasn’t improved in the second test at 5 minutes, or there are other concerns, the doctors and nurses will closely monitor your baby and continue any necessary medical care. The Apgar score is just one piece of information doctors and nurses have. It is a guide, but only a guide. It does not mean there are going to be any problems later in life. It does not predict your baby’s long-term development.

## baby movement when
* babymov/when
- You might start to feel your baby moving, often called ‘quickening’, around 18 weeks into your pregnancy. If this is your first pregnancy, it might not happen until about 20 weeks.

## baby movement feel
* babymov/feel
- The type of movements you feel will depend on what your baby is doing and their stage of growth and development. Each infant is different, with some more active than others. The first sensations you feel may be a fluttering (like ‘butterflies in your tummy’), swishing, rolling or tumbling sensation or a tiny kick. As your pregnancy progresses, the movements normally become more distinct and frequent.

## baby movement frequency
* babymov/often
- Once you easily feel your baby’s movements (around 20–24 weeks), you’ll notice them more often. However, you may not always feel your baby’s movements, especially if you are busy and are not paying attention. Babies tend to move more at certain times of day – they may be more active while you sleep, and sleep while you’re awake. Usually, unborn babies sleep for 20-40 minutes at a time (occasionally up to 90 minutes), and they don’t move when they’re asleep. You might not notice your baby’s movements as easily while you’re sitting or standing as when you lie down and concentrate on them.

## baby movement problem
* babymov/problem
- If you haven’t felt any movement from your baby by 24 weeks, see your doctor or midwife. If your baby’s movements decrease or stop, it may be a sign that there’s a problem. If you are concerned your baby is moving less after 28 weeks or you are worried for any reason, then do a simple check. Lie on your left side (your baby bump supported with a pillow) and focus for two hours on any sensations you feel from your baby. If you do not feel 10 or more distinct movements in two hours, contact your doctor, midwife or maternity unit right away.

## backache causes
* backache/causes
- Backache during pregnancy is very common, especially in the later stages when your ligaments loosen and the growing baby affects your posture. You gain a lot of weight in your abdomen which puts extra strain on the arch in your lower back and it can also strain the joints.

## backache treatment
* backache/treatments
- If you injure your back while you are pregnant, simple exercises and using back support are usually enough to fix the injury. In very rare cases, pregnant women can have a serious injury such as a herniated disc. In this case you might need surgery. Back surgery is usually safe, however, both for you and your baby during pregnancy.

## backache prevent
* backache/prevent
- You can protect your back during pregnancy by avoiding or changing the way you do some things. To prevent a back injury: avoid heavy lifting, always have a good posture, avoid activities that might hurt your back, be careful in bed, and wear shoes with low heels (not flats) as they have good arch support. 

## umbilical what
* umbilical/what
- In the womb, the umbilical cord delivers the oxygen and nutrients needed to allow your baby to grow. After birth, the cord is clamped and cut, leaving a stump. This eventually falls off, healing to form the umbilicus (belly button).

## umbilical duration
* umbilical/duration
- The cord stump usually stays attached for 5 to 15 days. Over this time, the cord dries, shrinks and turns black. Sometimes, especially in the day or so before it falls off, the stump can ooze a little and may leave marks on your baby’s clothes. Do not pull the cord stump off, even if it looks like it will come off easily, as this can prolong healing time and cause scarring. Let the cord stump fall off by itself in its own time.

## umbilical care
* umbilical/care
- Wash the cord stump as part of your baby’s usual bathing routine. Make sure you wash your hands first. Use only water and cotton pads, and dry it carefully. If wee or poo gets on the stump, you can use a mild soap to help clean it off. You don’t need to use antiseptics and alcohol. Let the cord sit out of the nappy so it dries out in the air; this can be done by folding the nappy under the cord stump. There is no need to cover the cord stump with Band-Aids or bandages, as this stops airflow around the stump.

## umbilical heal
* umbilical/heal
- After the cord falls off, the belly button may bleed or ooze a little, but it should heal completely in days. If there is continuous stickiness or discharge, it may be infected, and you should show your doctor or maternal and child health nurse. Sometimes the belly button does not heal completely and moist red tissue forms over the stump site, often with a lump present. This is called a ‘granuloma’. It is usually harmless, but you should ask your GP or child and family nurse to have a look at it.

## umbilical infection
* umbilical/infection
- Signs of an infection of the belly button may include: redness, swelling, stickiness or a bad smell on or around the belly button, fevers, poor feeding and tiredness in your baby. If you think your baby’s cord stump or belly button is infected, see your doctor as soon as possible.

## birth trauma
* birthTrauma/what
- Birth trauma is distress experienced by a mother during or after childbirth. While trauma can be physical, it is often emotional and psychological. Birth trauma is not just about what happened during labour and the birth. It can also refer to how you, as the mother, are left feeling afterwards. Sometimes the effects of birth trauma can emerge, and continue for, some time after you’ve given birth. After the birth, it’s possible to feel shocked, guilty or numb and even experience panic attacks or anxiety. If you notice any of these symptoms, you may be experiencing birth trauma.

## birth trauma risk
* birthTrauma/risk
- There are many factors that can contribute to birth trauma. These include: your childbirth experience not going to plan, or not matching your expectations, having a difficult labour that was long or painful experiencing labour complications, needing intervention during labour, you or your baby suffering birth injury, your baby needing medical attention after the birth, stillbirth or neonatal death, not receiving the care or support you needed at the time of birth, previous birth trauma, and a tendency to experience anxiety.

## birth trauma prevention
* birthTrauma/prevent
- Childbirth doesn’t always go to plan. Many women who experience birth trauma are unable to avoid it as the risk factors (for example, a history of trauma) are beyond their control. However, there are ways to help reduce the risk of birth trauma: Prepare for childbirth, try to have realistic expectations, try to keep an open mind, establish a support network, and seek mental health support. 

## breast feeding nipples
* breastfeeding/nipples
- Sore, cracked or bleeding nipples are common. As a new mother, you may find it could take a few days or weeks to adapt to the strong suck of a healthy baby on your breasts. It is normal for your breasts to become more sensitive in the first weeks after you have given birth. They may sting, burn, ache or feel tender. Over time, the discomfort and sensitivity should resolve. If you have sore nipples, it may be that your baby isn’t attaching properly to your breast. This pain usually lasts about half a minute while baby first draws your nipple into their mouth.

## breast feeding what
* breastfeeding/what
- Breastfeeding is the most natural way to feed your baby. It provides all the nutrition your baby needs during the first six months of life, satisfies their hunger and thirst at the same time. It also helps to create a loving bond between you and your baby.

## breast feeding benefits
* breastfeeding/benefits
- Breast milk has a number of health benefits for your baby. Breastmilk contains all the nutrients your baby needs for the first 6 months, it satisfies the baby’s thirst, it helps develop the eyes and brain and other body systems, the act of breastfeeding helps with jaw development, it helps the baby resist infection and disease, it reduces the risk of obesity in childhood and later in life, and it contains a range of factors that protect your baby while their immune system is still developing. Breastfeeding also has many benefits for mothers. Not only is it convenient, cheap, and always available, it also: reduces the risk of haemorrhage immediately after delivery, reduces your risk of breast and ovarian cancer, is convenient and cheap, can soothe your baby, and prolongs the amount of time before you get your period again.

## breast feeding how to
* breastfeeding/how_to
- The key to successful breastfeeding is comfortable positioning and good attachment. If your baby is well-attached to your breast you are less likely to experience breastfeeding problems like cracked nipples, and your baby will get the most amount of milk out of your breast. There are lots of different ways to position and attach your baby for breastfeeding, but here are some general tips: Sit comfortably with your back and feet supported – you can be fully upright or you might prefer to be laying back a little bit. Unwrap your baby and hold him or her close against you.Turn your baby on his or her side so they are wrapped around you with their nose level with your nipple. Make sure you support your baby’s neck and shoulders with your hand, but don’t hold your baby’s head — allow him or her to find the best position for attaching to your breast. Bring your baby to your breast, not your breast to your baby. Gently brush your baby’s mouth with the underside of your areola (the area around the nipple) — this will usually cause your baby to open their mouth very wide. When your baby opens their mouth, bring him or her quickly to your breast so they take a good mouthful of breast tissue. As you bring your baby to your breast it can help to hold your breast like you would a sandwich, with your nipple aimed at the roof of your baby’s mouth.

## breast feeding start
* breastfeeding/start
- You can usually start breastfeeding within the first hour or so of your baby’s birth. The first milk in your breasts is called colostrum. This milk is quite thick and may be yellowish in colour. It’s very rich in protein and antibodies that will help give your baby a great start in life. Mature breast milk gradually replaces the colostrum in the first few days after birth

## breast feeding often
* breastfeeding/often
- During the first week of life most babies will gradually develop a pattern of feeding eight to twelve times in a 24-hour period. You should feed your baby whenever he or she shows signs of hunger. You will know your baby is getting enough breast milk if he or she:
-- is feeding at least 8 times a day (with some of those feeds occurring overnight)
-- has at least 5 wet disposable nappies or 6 to 8 wet cloth nappies per day
-- has 2 or more soft or runny bowel movements per day for around the first 6 weeks of life (babies have fewer bowel movements once they reach about 6 weeks)
-- is gaining weight and growing as expected
-- is alert when awake, and reasonably contented

## breast feeding milk
* breastfeeding/milk
-- When it comes to breastfeeding, supply equals demand. The more you feed your baby, the more milk your breasts will make. Some tips for establishing and maintaining a good milk supply include:
-- let your baby feed until he or she stops sucking and swallowing and lets go of your breast, and then offer your second breast
-- offer your breast at night as well as during the day
-- avoid giving any extra feeds from bottles, as this reduces your baby’s need to suck at your breast and reduces your milk supply
-- avoid the use of dummies (pacifiers)

## breech what
* breech/what
- By around the eighth month most babies will be in a vertical, head down position in the birth canal. Some babies, however, settle in a breech position. When a baby is positioned bottom-down late in pregnancy, this is called the breech position. 

## breech why
* breech/why
- Often it is unclear why a baby remains in a breech position, however, some of the common reasons include:
-- too much or too little amniotic fluid around the baby
-- the length of the umbilical cord
-- multiple pregnancy – for example, often one twin will be in a cephalic position and the other in a breech position
-- uterine fibroids
-- an irregular size or shape of the mother’s uterus

## breech how
* breech/how
- Your doctor or midwife will feel your abdomen whenever you have your pregnancy check-ups in second and third trimesters – this is called an ‘abdominal palpation’. When they feel your abdomen at 35-36 weeks, they will assess whether the baby has settled into a head-down position in preparation for birth. If they suspect your baby might be in a breech position, they can confirm this with an ultrasound scan.

## breech how
* breech/options
- Women are often encouraged to have a caesarean birth if their baby is breech. But a breech vaginal birth might be possible, depending on your individual circumstances, the type of breech position your baby is in, and the skills of the doctors and midwives available to you. 

## breech turn
* breech/turn
- Some breech babies turn themselves naturally in the last month of pregnancy. If this is your first baby and they are breech at 36 weeks, the chance of the baby turning itself naturally before you go into labour is about 1 in 8. If you’ve already had a baby and this one is breech at 36 weeks, the chance of them turning naturally is about 1 in 3.

## csection what
* csection/what
- A caesarean section is a surgical procedure to deliver a baby through a cut in the mother’s abdomen (tummy) and uterus (womb).

## csection why
* csection/why
- The most common reasons for needing a caesarean are:
-- your baby is in the breech position (bottom first) and your doctor doesn’t recommend a vaginal breech birth
-- your baby is transverse (lying sideways) and can’t be turned by the doctor
-- you have twins and the first one is in the breech position
-- your placenta is partly or completely covering the cervix (opening to the womb)
-- you have had a previous caesarean

## csection process
* csection/process
- Firstly, you will usually receive a regional anaesthetic, such as an epidural, which numbs the lower part of your body. This means you will get to be awake throughout the operation. Sometimes emergency caesareans must be done under general anaesthetic, which means you won’t be conscious during the birth. Your tummy will be cleaned and a tube, known as a catheter, will be inserted into your bladder to collect urine. You will have intravenous (IV) lines inserted into your arm to deliver fluid and medicines. The obstetrician will make a cut through the wall of your tummy, usually low and across near the pubic hair line. If your baby needs to be delivered very quickly, the cut may be made vertically from just below the belly button to above the pubic bone. The doctor will then cut through the layers of fatty tissue and muscle, and finally cut through the uterus. The baby is delivered through the cuts. The doctor will clear the baby’s nose and mouth of fluids and clamp the umbilical cord. If you are awake they will hold your baby up so that you can see. They will then remove the placenta and close the cuts with stitches or staples.

## csection risks
* csection/risks
- Caesareans are safe. But it is major surgery and, like all surgery, there are risks to you, which include:
-- blood loss
-- blood clots
-- infection in the wound
-- problems with the anaesthetic
-- possible damage to other organs nearby, such as the bladder

## cvs what
* cvs/what
- Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a test carried out during pregnancy to detect specific abnormalities in an unborn baby. A sample of cells is taken from the placenta (the organ that links the mother’s blood supply with her unborn baby’s) and tested for genetic defects.

## cvs why
* cvs/why
- CVS may be offered when there is an increased risk that the baby may have a chromosome problem or other type of birth defect. Some of the most common reasons include: If the woman will be older than 35 at the time of delivery of the baby, If increased risk of a chromosome problem is identified on a screening test, such as first trimester screening, If ultrasound detects unexpected abnormalities in the baby, If the parents have had a previous baby with a chromosome problem, or a parent has a variation of the chromosomes that increases the chance of the baby having a chromosome problem, and If there is an increased risk that the baby may have a particular genetic disorder, for which a test is available.

## cvs when
* cvs/when
- CVS is usually done around 10-11 weeks of pregnancy. CVS can be carried out earlier than amniocentesis, which is usually carried out between weeks 15 and 20 of pregnancy.

## cvs risk
* cvs/risk
- CVS increases your risk of miscarriage, but only 1 in every 100 pregnancies that end in miscarriage would be directly due to CVS. The specific figure for the risk of a miscarriage depends on the experience of the doctor doing the test and the difficulty he or she has in obtaining the sample. It is therefore important that a CVS test is only carried out by a doctor experienced in this technique and it should be done after the 11th week of pregnancy.

## fertile window
* getting_preg/fertilewindow
- An egg survives no more than 24 hours after ovulation - unless, of course, it is fertilised by a sperm. However, sperm can survive for longer within the genital tract (your vagina, uterus or fallopian tubes). This means that you don't have to time sex at the exact moment of ovulation to get pregnant. It is probably more realistic to think of a "fertile window" of about five to 6 days when live, healthy sperm could meet a freshly ovulated egg - about five days before ovulation and the day of ovulation.

## ovulation signs
* getting_preg/ovulationsigns
- You will usually ovulate around 12 to 16 days before your next period starts (on average 14 days). This means that if your menstrual cycle is regular and about 28 days long, you may ovulate about 12 to 16 days after the beginning of your last period. Some women can tell when they are ovulating because their cervical mucus becomes more plentiful and slippery. Some women also experience a sharp pain low down on one side of their abdomen. Many women find that their libido (desire for sex) increases around the time they ovulate.

## when to have sex
* getting_preg/when
- If you have unprotected sex every two to three days then healthy sperm with good motility will be in the right place whenever you ovulate. Regular sex throughout your cycle is the approach that fertility experts recommend for increasing your chances of getting pregnant. Having sex when your cervical mucus is wet, slippery and therefore most receptive to sperm will increase your chances of getting pregnant.

## Group B Strep What
* groupb/what
- Group B strep is a type of bacteria commonly found in the intestines, rectum or vagina. Many women have it, and it usually causes no health concerns or symptoms. Some women infected with group B strep get a urinary tract infection, and it increases the risk of a miscarriage only very slightly. The main concern is passing it on to the baby before or during during a vaginal birth. While many babies who get infected stay healthy, a small proportion (about 1 in 200) become very sick within the first few days of life. They get serious infections such as pneumonia and blood poisoning, or meningitis, which is an infection around the brain. These seriously ill babies are treated with intravenous antibiotics. Most recover with no side-effects, but some don’t survive. 

## Group B Strep What
* groupb/how
- The group B strep test is a routine antenatal tests, and it involves taking a swab of the inside of the vagina. Your doctor or midwife will do this, or you may be able to do it yourself. The swab is taken at 35 to 37 weeks’ pregnancy. Tests done earlier in your pregnancy aren’t a good guide to your condition at birth because the bacteria can come and go.

## Group B Strep Risk
* groupb/risk
- Babies are more likely to be infected with group B strep if: they are born-or your waters break-before 37 weeks, you give birth more than 18 hours after your waters break, you have a fever (over 38°C) while in labour, you’ve had a previous child with severe group B strep infection, a urine test during pregnancy detected group B strep, and a swab taken no more than 5 weeks earlier detected group B strep.

## Group B prevention
* groupb/prevention
- If your group B test at 35 to 37 weeks was positive, or if you have the risk factors listed above, your doctor or midwife will probably recommend that you have intravenous antibiotics when your waters break or labour starts. Often this is penicillin, but alternatives are available if you are allergic to penicillin. The antibiotics pass through the placenta and into the baby. This greatly reduces your baby’s chances of becoming ill. There’s no need for antibiotics before a planned caesarean because the baby will not pass through the vagina. You can’t pass the bacteria to your baby through the placenta.

## Jaundice what
* jaundice/what
- Two or three days after birth you may notice that your baby's skin has a yellow colour - this is called jaundice. Jaundice often develops in normal healthy babies in the first week or so of life. Jaundice can be seen in about 60% of full term babies (babies who are born after about 38 weeks of pregnancy). It is even more common in babies who are born early or who are sick. Some babies will need treatment for the jaundice, while for most the jaundice will not last long (between 1 and 2 weeks) and not cause problems even without treatment.

## Jaundice causes
* jaundice/causes
- Jaundice is caused by high levels of a chemical called bilirubin in the baby's body. Red blood cells are being made and being broken down continually in all people, including babies before and after birth. Haemoglobin in the red blood cells breaks down into smaller chemicals including bilirubin. Before birth the bilirubin is carried out of the baby through the placenta, and into the mother's blood. When a baby is born, the baby's liver suddenly has to take over the work of getting rid of bilirubin and it can take the liver a few days to fully manage this.

## Jaundice treatment
* jaundice/treatment
- Most babies who are well and who are mildly jaundiced will not need treatment. As the liver matures, it will break the bilirubin into other chemicals which can be passed out through the gut. Phototherapy (or light therapy) may be used for babies whose level is getting higher. Light energy helps change the bilirubin that is just under the skin into a different chemical which is more easily passed out of the baby's body (excreted). Babies may need phototherapy for several days. Phototherapy is safe and effective.

## Placenta what
* placenta/what
- Normally, the position of the placenta will move as the womb grows and stretches, so that eventually, by the last three months of pregnancy, it should be near the top of the womb. In some cases however, (one in 200 pregnancies) the placenta stays in the lower portion (part) of the womb, and either partially or completely covers the cervix (neck of the womb). This is known as placenta praevia.

## Placenta causes
* placenta/causes
- Often there is no obvious cause for placenta praevia, but the placenta may develop lower than it should because: there is a large placental area (eg. with twins),  there may be scarring of the lining of the uterus from previous caesarean or curette, there may be late implantation of a fertilized ovum (egg), and smoking may increase your risk (cause unknown). Nothing you do can change placenta praevia. Only growth of the womb over time can improve the position of the placenta.

## Placenta signs
* placenta/signs
- Placenta praevia is usually picked up with an ultrasound between 18-20 weeks. If a "low lying placenta" is found, a further scan is done at 32 weeks to see if the placenta is still low. Only two to five percent of placentas that are "low lying" on the early scan become placenta praevia grade three or four later in the pregnancy. Some of the signs of placenta paervia include: Sudden/painless/bright red vaginal loss (usually in the later half of the pregnancy), painless vaginal bleeding after sex, uterine cramping with bleeding, and bleeding during labour.

## PND what
* pnd/what
- Postnatal depression is the name given to depression that develops between one month and up to one year after the birth of a baby. All parents go through a period of adjustment as they try to handle the huge changes a baby brings. For most people, this time of adjustment will be temporary and will not be overly distressing. Many women experience the ‘baby blues’ in the first few days after having a baby. The baby blues usually only last 2 to 3 days and you might feel teary, anxious and moody during that time. The support of your partner, family and friends is usually enough to help you get through it. When these feelings last beyond these early days and continue to get worse, it may be a sign of developing depression.

## PND signs
* pnd/signs
- There are many signs that someone may be struggling with postnatal depression. Some of the more common ones include: having a very low mood, feeling inadequate and a failure as a mother, having a sense of hopelessness about the future feeling exhausted, empty, sad and teary, feeling guilty, ashamed or worthless, feeling anxious or panicky, having trouble sleeping, sleeping for too long or having nightmares, worrying excessively about their baby, and feeling scared of being alone or going out.

## PND signs
* pnd/treatment
- A range of different treatments can help with postnatal depression, including: counselling, psychotherapy, group treatment, support strategies, medications such as antidepressants.
