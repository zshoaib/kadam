  utter_alcohol:
  - text: Whether you are planning a pregnancy, already pregnant or breastfeeding,
      not drinking is the safest option as alcohol can harm your unborn baby.
  utter_alcohol_harm:
  - text: When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta and
      to your unborn baby. It can affect the development of the baby’s brain, spinal
      cord and other organs. Drinking alcohol while pregnant can increase the risk
      of miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth and a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      (FASD), which is a range of physical, cognitive, developmental and emotional
      problems caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

  utter_antenatalTests:
  - text: During your pregnancy, you’ll be offered a range of tests, including blood
      tests and ultrasound scans. These tests are designed to check for anything that
      may cause a problem during your pregnancy or after the birth. These tests include
      weight and height, ultrasound scans, urine, blood pressure, blood tests, cervical
      screening test, and Group B streptococcus.

  utter_asthma:
  - text: Pregnancy is not likely to bring on asthma if you didn’t previously have
      it, but the effect of pregnancy on women who do have asthma is unpredictable.
      Around one-third of pregnant women will see an improvement, one-third will see
      no change and one-third will experience a worsening of their symptoms.

  utter_bladder_weakness:
  - text: Leaking urine after childbirth is very common. One in three women who have
      had a baby have wet themselves at some point. When your baby moves down through
      your vagina to be born, your pelvic floor stretches and it remains stretched
      for some time. The combination of hormones and stretched muscles means the muscles
      that control your bladder are weakened. This can lead to your accidentally leakage
      urine. It’s common for a new mother to accidentally leak urine when she laughs,
      sneezes, coughs or exercises. This is known as stress incontinence. Most women
      who leak urine after childbirth find that it goes away in the first few weeks,
      since the stretched muscles and tissues recover.
  utter_bleeding:
  - text: Bleeding during pregnancy is relatively common. However, bleeding from the
      vagina at any time in pregnancy can be a dangerous sign. During the first 12
      weeks of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of miscarriage or ectopic
      pregnancy. n the later stages of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can have many different
      causes such as changes in the cervix, a 'show', placental abruption, placenta
      praevia, and vasa praevia. You should always contact your midwife or doctor
      immediately if you start bleeding.

  utter_constipation:
  - text: You may become constipated very early in pregnancy because of the hormonal
      changes in your body. Constipation can mean that you are not passing stools
      (faeces) as often as you normally do, you have to strain more than usual or
      you are unable to completely empty your bowels. Constipation can also cause
      your stools to be unusually hard, lumpy, large or small. There are a few things
      you can do to help prevent constipation. These include- \n Eat foods that are
      high in fibre, such as wholemeal breads, wholegrain cereals, fruit and vegetables,
      and pulses such as beans and lentils. \n Move regularly to keep your muscles
      toned. \n Drink plenty of water — enough that you not thirsty. \n Only take
      iron supplements if needed, as they can make you constipated- if you become
      constipated ask your doctor if you can manage without them or change to a different
      type.

  utter_dontcare:

  utter_early_symptoms:
  - text: Some early signs of pregnancy are missed period, fatigue, a heightened sense
      of smell, morning sickness, food aversions, mood swings, tender breasts, darkening
      aerolas, frequent urination, and bloating. As soon as you think you could be
      pregnant, you should check to find out if you are. There are several ways to
      find out if you are in fact pregnant- \n you can test your urine at home with
      a home pregnancy test \n you can have a blood test ordered by your doctor \n
      you can have your urine tested by your doctor \n your doctor can do an internal
      examination.
  utter_emotions:
  - text: Pregnancy is a challenging and exciting time. It is normal for expectant
      mums and dads to experience ups and downs when expecting a baby. However, for
      some, anxiety and depression during pregnancy can affect their daily lives.
      Look out for these symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy- panic
      attacks (racing heart, palpitations, shortness of breath), persistent fears
      for the health or wellbeing of the baby, obsessive or compulsive behaviours,
      abrupt mood swings, feeling constantly sad or crying for no obvious reason,
      being nervous, on edge, or panicky. If symptoms last for more than 2 weeks,
      talk to your GP or midwife.
  utter_episitomy:
  - text: An episiotomy is a procedure performed during labour where a small cut is
      made to widen your vagina opening to assist with the delivery of your baby.
      An episiotomy may be recommended if your baby develops a condition known as
      ‘fetal distress’. Fetal distress is where the baby’s heart rate significantly
      increases or decreases before birth. This means that the baby may not be getting
      enough oxygen and has to be delivered quickly to avoid the risk of birth defects
      or stillbirth. If a caesarean section is not appropriate - for example, because
      the baby’s head is already moving down the birth canal, an episiotomy can be
      the best way to speed up birth.
  utter_episitomy_how:
  - text: An episiotomy is usually a simple operation where a surgical cut is made
      in the woman’s perineum (area between the vagina and anus). Local anaesthetic
      is used to numb the area around the vagina so you will not feel any pain. If
      you’ve already had an epidural, the dose can be ‘topped up’ before the cut is
      made.
  utter_exercise:
  - text: Doing regular physical activity has health benefits during pregnancy and
      also helps to prepare the body for childbirth. However, it is important to modify
      or choose a suitable exercise program because pregnancy affects the body’s response
      to exercise. Don’t exhaust yourself - a light to moderate exercise program should
      be the aim.
  utter_exercise_avoid:
  - text: There are some exercise you should avoid if you are pregnant. \n Don’t lie
      flat on your back, particularly after 16 weeks, because the weight of your bump
      presses on the big blood vessels and can make you feel faint and reduce blood
      flow to your baby. \n Don’t take part in contact sports where there’s a risk
      of being hit, such as kickboxing, judo, squash, tennis, football or rugby. \n
      Don’t take part in horse riding, downhill skiing, ice hockey, gymnastics and
      cycling, because there’s a risk of falling. \n Don’t go scuba-diving, because
      the baby has no protection against decompression sickness and gas embolism (gas
      bubbles in the bloodstream). \n Don’t exercise at heights over 2,500m above
      sea level until you have acclimatised. This is because you and your baby are
      at risk of altitude sickness (a decrease in oxygen). \n Don’t do repetitive
      high impact exercise, or with lots of twists and turns, high stepping or sudden
      stops that cause joint discomfort. \n Don’t do exercise where you get too hot.
      Your body’s temperature is slightly higher when you are pregnant. Intensive
      exercise may cause your core temperature to rise to an unsafe level for your
      baby. Limit your exercise to moderate intensity, drink plenty of water, wear
      lightweight clothing and only exercise in cool, well ventilated places (no spas
      or saunas). \n
  utter_exercise_which:
  - text: If you are pregnant, try to fit the exercises listed below into your daily
      routine. They will strengthen your muscles so that you can carry the extra weight
      of pregnancy. They’ll also make joints stronger, improve circulation, ease backache
      and generally help you feel well. \n As your baby gets bigger, you may find
      that the hollow in your lower back increases and this can give you backache.
      These exercises strengthen stomach (abdominal) muscles and ease backache, which
      can be a problem in pregnancy- \n \n Stomach-strengthening exercises \n Start
      in a box position (on all fours) with knees under hips, hands under shoulders,
      with fingers facing forward and abdominals lifted to keep your back straight.
      \n Pull in your stomach muscles and raise your back up towards the ceiling,
      curling the trunk and allowing your head to relax gently forward. Don’t let
      your elbows lock. \n Hold for a few seconds then slowly return to the box position.
      \n Take care not to hollow your back; it should always return to a straight/neutral
      position. Do this slowly and rhythmically 10 times, making your muscles work
      hard and moving your back carefully. \n Only move your back as far as you can
      comfortably. \n \n  Pelvic tilt exercises \n Stand with your shoulders and bottom
      against a wall. \n Keep your knees soft. \n Pull your tummy button towards your
      spine, so that your back flattens against the wall; hold for four seconds and
      release. \n Repeat up to 10 times. \n \n Pelvic floor exercises \n Pelvic floor
      exercises help to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor, which come under
      great strain in pregnancy and childbirth. The pelvic floor consists of layers
      of muscles that stretch like a supportive hammock from the pubic bone (in front)
      to the end of the backbone.
  utter_fired:
  - text: You can come back to me any time. I will always be here to help.
  utter_forceps:
  - text: Obstetric forceps are sometimes needed to help deliver the baby. Forceps
      are specially designed to fit safely around the baby's head and guide it through
      the birth canal. Sometimes the forceps may leave small marks on the baby's cheeks
      that will disappear in a few days.
  utter_friend:
  - text: I thought we were already friends.
  utter_funny:
  - text: I am glad you think so.
  utter_gestd_causes:
  - text: In pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones that help the baby to grow
      and develop. These hormones also block the action of the mother’s insulin. This
      is called insulin resistance. Because of this insulin resistance, the need for
      insulin in pregnancy is 2 or 3 times higher than normal. If the body is unable
      to produce this much insulin, gestational diabetes develops. When the pregnancy
      is over and the insulin needs return to normal, the diabetes usually disappears.

  utter_harder_pregnancy:
  - text: Only about eight out of ten women will achieve a pregnancy within twelve
      months of trying, and about one in eight women have difficulties getting pregnant.
      Fertility (likelihood of getting pregnant) drops as you get older. Fewer women
      become pregnant in the first 12 months when they are more than 35 years old.
      Around 40 per cent of fertility problems originate in the man. These symptoms
      or situations may indicate that a woman may have a problem getting pregnant-
      Having irregular periods which may indicate problems with ovulation or due to
      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome,unusual pain with intercourse or when you have your
      periods (perhaps due to Endometriosis), and Pelvic inflammatory disease.
  utter_heartburn:
  - text: Heartburn is a very common and uncomfortable problem during pregnancy. \n
      You can relieve heartburn with an antacid solution or tablets. Ask your pharmacist,
      doctor or midwife to recommend a product that is suitable to use in pregnancy.
      \n You can also try to avoid heartburn by eating small meals, and avoiding fatty
      and spicy foods. \n Heartburn can be worse if you lie down after a big meal.
      \n Raising the head of your bed by about 15 cm may help with heartburn at night.
      \n Sometimes, drinking a glass of milk or eating some yoghurt may help prevent
      and relieve heartburn. \n

  utter_increase_chances:
  - text: You are most likely to become pregnant if you have intercourse around the
      time the woman ovulates, which is when an egg is released. Ovulation usually
      occurs about 14 days after the beginning of the previous period. Some women
      can tell when they are ovulating because their cervical mucus becomes more plentiful
      and slippery. Some women also experience a sharp pain low down on one side of
      their stomach. Many women find that their libido (desire for sex) increases
      around the time they ovulate. There are several simple steps that you can take
      to increase your chances of becoming pregnant, these include- become aware of
      your cycle so you 'get the timing right' , Stop smoking, Exercise regularly
      and moderately, eat a healthy diet and lose some weight if you are overweight,
      reduce coffee (and other caffeine drinks), alcohol and drugs, reduce exposure
      to toxins, heavy metals, chemicals, organic solvents, find ways to reduce stress
      and to relax, and try to get 6–8 hours sleep every night.
  utter_male_infertility:
  - text: New life begins when an egg from a woman is fertilised by sperm from a man.
      Around 20 million sperm per millilitre (ml) need to be present in the ejaculate,
      with enough mobility and strength to swim the journey to the fallopian tube,
      where conception normally takes place. Around 40 per cent of fertility problems
      originate in the man. Male fertility problems include problems with sperm production
      or blockages in the tubes of the reproductive system. The causes of male infertility
      include problems with sperm production, blockage of sperm transport from the
      testes, sperm antibodies, sexual problems such as impotence, and hormone problems.

  utter_no_pregnancy_doctor:
  - text: If you are a younger woman, you should give yourself 12 months before beginning
      to check why you are not pregnant. If you are over 35 years old, then six months
      of trying is probably long enough before getting help. It's important to remember
      that both you and your partner will need to have your fertility checked - this
      is not just a woman's problem. If you or your partner has any obvious problems,
      you may want to get help earlier than this.

  utter_overweight_preg_chances:
  - text: Your fertility will be best when you are close to your 'ideal' body weight
      - that is, you are not overweight and not underweight. Overweight women can
      have more ovulation problems (ovulate less often and more irregularly), reduced
      pregnancy and live birth rates, and more medical complications and are more
      likely to have high blood pressure during pregnancy. If you are overweight,
      you can improve your likelihood of becoming pregnant by losing weight through
      regular exercise and by eating a healthy diet.

      sarcoma, a rare cancer.
  utter_quest_10:
  - text: Unless you had chronic backaches before you got pregnant, your pain will
      likely ease gradually before you give birth.
  utter_quest_100:
  - text: Genital herpes can be passed from a mother to her baby during a vaginal
      delivery. Babies who come in contact with genital herpes can end up with damage
      to their eyes and central nervous systems. A herpes infection in a newborn can
      become life-threatening, affecting multiple organ systems rather than only the
      genitals.
  utter_quest_101:

  utter_quest_105:
  - text: Many doctors know that there's not good evidence that bed rest helps. But
      they try it anyway because they think it's harmless. Unfortunately, studies
      have found that bed rest poses real risks. They include:Blood clotsDepression
      and anxietyFamily stressFinancial worries, especially if you have to stop workingLow
      birth-weight for your babySlower recovery after birthWeakened bones and muscles
  utter_quest_106:

      shouldn't last too much longer.
  utter_quest_107:
  - text: CVS may carry a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis,
      because it’s done in early pregnancy. Infection may also happen. Rare cases
      of defects in a baby's fingers or toes have been reported, especially when CVS
      was done before 9 weeks. This risk seems unrelated to the doctor’s experience
      or how the test was done. Due to this potential risk, 10 weeks is generally
      the earliest recommended time to have this test.
  utter_quest_108:
  - text: Emergency C-sections are done when the mother or the baby may be in danger.
      Doctors can get the baby out as quickly as in one minute. If you had an epidural
      while you attempted vaginal delivery, your anesthesiologist may have time to
      give you enough medicine through your epidural so you’ll be able to be awake
      during the C-section. If not, you may get general anesthesia so you won’t be
      awake during your C-section.
  utter_quest_109:
  - text: Premature labor is labor that begins before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Although
      there is no way to know which women will experience preterm labor or birth,
      there are factors that place women at higher risk, such as certain infections,
      a shortened cervix, or previous preterm birth.
  utter_quest_11:
  - text: A pudenal block is an injection that can block pain between your vagina
      and anus (perineum). It takes about 10-20 minutes to work, and it rarely has
      any negative effects. But it may not work for some people, and it can cause
      an allergic reaction or even an infection. It can also lower your blood pressure.
      This method is used less often nowadays.

  utter_quest_111:
  - text: It's normal to see a thin, milky white vaginal discharge (called leukorrhea)
      early in your pregnancy. You can wear a panty liner if it makes you feel more
      comfortable, but don't use a tampon because it can introduce germs into the
      vagina. If the discharge is foul-smelling, green or yellow, bloody, or if there's
      a lot of clear discharge, call your doctor.

  - text: Here are some tips that may help you kick the habit-- Hide your matches,
      lighters, and ashtrays.Designate your home a non-smoking area. Ask people who
      smoke not to smoke around you. Drink fewer caffeinated beverages-- caffeine
      may stimulate your urge to smoke. Also avoid alcohol, as it may also increase
      your urge to smoke and can be harmful to your baby. Change your habits connected
      with smoking. If you smoked while driving or when feeling stressed, try other
      activities to replace smoking. Keep mints or gum (preferably sugarless) on hand
      for those times when you get the urge to smoke. Stay active to keep your mind
      off smoking and help relieve tension-- take a walk, exercise, read a book, or
      try a new a hobby.Look for support from others. Join a support group or smoking
      cessation program.Do not go to places where many people are smoking such as
      bars or clubs, and smoking sections of restaurants.
  utter_quest_115:
  - text: Talk to your doctor or midwife about why they think you should have a C-section.
      If the baby's size is the reason, ask how accurate the weight estimates are.
      Find out if other things can address their concern.Will you be able to wait
      until 39 or 40 weeks, as some recommend?Make sure you understand what harm could
      come to you and your baby if you don't have a C-section.If you want to have
      more children, find out if you'll need C-sections for future deliveries.Think
      about whether or not the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.
  utter_quest_116:
  - text: During pregnancy, the fetus is surrounded by amniotic fluid, a substance
      much like water. Amniotic fluid contains live fetal cells and other substances,
      such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). These substances provide important information
      about your baby's health before birth.
  utter_quest_117:
  - text: A number of vaccines, especially live-virus vaccines, shouldn't be given
      to pregnant women because they may be harmful to the baby. (A live-virus vaccine
      is made using the live strains of a virus.) Some vaccines can be given to the
      mother in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, while others should only
      be given at least 3 months before or immediately after the baby is born.
  utter_quest_118:
  - text: One of the first questions your pediatrician may ask after your son’s birth
      is whether you plan to have him circumcised. It’s a relatively common surgical
      procedure where your baby’s foreskin -- the hood of skin that covers the head
      of his penis -- is removed. If a baby is going to have the surgery, it’s usually
      done before he leaves the hospital, 2-3 days after birth. If you’re considering
      it.

  - text: Your doctor will take out the cervical stitches before you give birth. This
      is usually around 37 weeks of pregnancy. She’ll do it sooner if you go into
      labor.If you deliver by C-section and hope to have more children, you may be
      able to keep the cervical stitches in place. But that could make it more difficult
      for you to get pregnant again. Talk to your doctor about it.If you got the stitches
      through your belly, your doctor will most likely recommend a C-section when

  - text: A test called the non-stress test (NST) is commonly done to evaluate the
      health of the unborn baby. The non-stress test involves placement of a fetal
      monitor on the mother's belly and interpretation of the fetal heart rate. It
      generally takes only 20 to 30 minutes and doesn't require hospital admission.Interpretation
      of the non-stress test can sometimes be misleading; there is a relatively high
      rate of false-positive results, which means that the test may come back positive
      but the baby is actually well. Oftentimes, the non-stress test is abnormal,
      even though there are no problems with the baby, and it's difficult to decide
      what to do next.

      Equally important is feeling emotionally ready, physically comfortable, and
      relaxed. For both you and your partner, patience is a virtue. Given the realities

      to screen for down syndrome may be available between 11 and 14 weeks of pregnancy.
      The results of a blood test that measures hCG and/or PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated
      plasma protein A) in maternal blood are used with an ultrasound measurement
      of the skin at the back of the fetus’ neck (called nuchal translucency). The
      procedure may be able to pick up a substantial portion of Down syndrome cases
      and other genetic conditions. But with all screening methods, a more invasive
      diagnostic technique like chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is used if results
      are positive.Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) screening- This cell-free
      fetal DNA test can be done as early as after 10 weeks of pregnancy. The test
      uses a blood sample to measure the relative amount of free fetal DNA in a mother's
      blood. It's thought that the test can detect 99% of all Down syndrome pregnancies.
      It also tests for some other chromosomal abnormalities. Chorionic villus sampling
      (CVS)- If you're 35 or older, have a family history of certain diseases, or
      have had a positive result on non-invasive genetic tests, you will be offered
      this optional, invasive test usually between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. CVS
      can detect many genetic defects, such as Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia,
      cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy. The procedure involves
      either threading a tiny catheter through your cervix or inserting a needle into
      your abdomen to obtain a tissue sample from the placenta. The procedure carries
      a 1% risk of inducing miscarriage and is about 98% accurate in ruling out certain
      chromosomal birth defects. But unlike amniocentesis, it does not help in detecting
      neural tube disorders, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, or abdominal wall

      relaxes and the abdomen softens. The way a contraction feels is different for
      each woman, and may feel different from one pregnancy to the next, but labor
      contractions usually cause discomfort or a dull ache in your back and lower
      abdomen, along with pressure in the pelvis. Contractions move in a wave-like
      motion from the top of the uterus to the bottom. Some women describe contractions
      as strong menstrual cramps. Unlike false labor contractions or Braxton-Hicks
      contractions, true labor contractions do not stop when you change your position
      or relax. Although the contractions may be uncomfortable, you will be able to
      relax in between contractions.

      leading to a brief decrease in blood flow to the fetus. This can cause sudden,
      short drops in fetal heart rate, called variable decelerations, which are usually
      picked up by monitors during labor. Cord compression happens in about one in
      10 deliveries. In most cases, these heart rate changes aren't a major deal and
      the birth happens normally. But a C-section may be necessary if the baby's heart
      rate worsens or the baby shows other signs of distress.

  - text: Your hormone levels change throughout your menstrual cycle. During the first
      half, your ovaries give off the hormone estrogen. When your estrogen levels
      get high enough, your ovary releases an egg. Then, your body starts to make
      progesterone, another hormone. It causes your body temperature to rise slightly.Track
      your temperature every day before you get out of bed. This reading is known
      as your basal body temperature. If you keep tabs over a few months, you may
      notice a pattern that shows when you ovulate. That will help you plot your fertile
      window.Your hormones also change the texture of your cervical mucus, the sticky
      fluid that comes from your cervix, the bottom of your uterus. As your body gets
      ready to ovulate, you have more of it, and it feels more stretchy and slippery,
      like raw egg whites. The texture helps sperm swim inside your body. When your
      mucus feels like this, you should be in your fertile window.

      breathing before your pain gets too strong. Start and end every contraction
      with a deep, cleansing breaths. Let your belly rise and fall with your breaths.
      This forces the muscles that instinctively tense with a contraction to relax.

      cut in the mother’s belly and womb. You can try gentle exercises a few days
      after the C-section- Deep breathing- Take 2-3 slow, deep breaths every half
      hour. This can help prevent lung congestion from sitting in bed so much. Shoulder
      circling- Sit upright and roll your shoulders 20 times in both directions every
      hour to help with stiffness. Gentle stretching- Stand against a wall and raise
      both arms slowly above your head until you feel the muscles in your belly stretch.
      Hold for 5 seconds, and then relax. You can do this up to 10 times a day to

      at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. Getting enough folic acid every day before
      and during the first three months of pregnancy can help prevent defects involving
      a baby's brain and spinal cord. Taking folic acid adds an important level of
      protection for older women, who have a higher risk of having a baby with birth
      defects. Some prenatal vitamins have 800-1,000 mcg of folic acid. This is still
      safe in pregnancy. As a matter of fact, some women need more than 400 mcg for
      protection against birth defects. Do not take more than 1,000 mcg (1 milligram)

      It begins when your cervix starts to open (dilate) and ends when it is completely
      open (fully dilated) at 10 centimeters. When the cervix dilates from 0 to 3
      or 4 centimeters, contractions get stronger as time progresses. Mild contractions
      begin at 15 to 20 minutes apart and last 60 to 90 seconds. The contractions
      become more regular until they are less than 5 minutes apart. This part of labor
      (called the latent phase) is best experienced in the comfort of your home.When
      the cervix dilates from 4 to 8 centimeters (called the active phase), contractions
      get stronger and are about 3 minutes apart, lasting about 45 seconds. You may

      this kind of information early allows a woman to make choices in the beginning
      stage of her pregnancy. If a woman chooses to end the pregnancy after she gets
      abnormal test results, the termination will be safer than if she waits until
      later for amniocentesis results.

      cycle and record how long it lasts. Day 1 is the first day of your period. Since
      the length of your cycle can vary slightly from month to month, it's best to
      keep track for a few months.Once you have an average, subtract 18 days from
      the length of your shortest cycle. This is the first day you're likely to be
      fertile. Next, subtract 11 days from the length of your longest cycle. This
      is the last day you're likely to be fertile. Having sex between those two dates

      mothers who smoke early in their pregnancies are more likely to deliver babies
      that have several different heart defects, including septal defects - essentially
      a hole in the wall between the heart’s left and right chambers. Sadly, most
      infants with congenital heart defects die in the first year of life. Those infants
      who survive often face lengthy hospital stays and numerous surgeries along with
      a lifetime of disabilities.Women who smoke are also more likely to have placenta
      problems. This is a serious concern because the placenta provides nourishment
      to the baby in the womb. Smokers also have low-birth-weight babies, premature

      a huge variation in training. There is also a lack of certification standards
      nationwide. This is especially true for the specialty of pregnancy massage.
      Not all states have laws requiring a set minimum training for a massage therapist,

      The reason is the potential for miscarriage. Some pregnancy massage experts
      argue that pregnancy massage doesn't, in itself, cause miscarriage, but no research
      has been done to show a link between a massage and a miscarriage. Because many
      miscarriages happen in the first trimester, some massage therapists and doctors
      counsel against first-trimester massage simply to avoid any potential liability

      you drink - you and your baby still need plenty of water. \n
  utter_vaginal_trush:
  - text: Many women notice that they have an increased vaginal discharge during pregnancy.
      This is quite normal, unless the discharge becomes thick, is itchy, uncomfortable
      or has an unpleasant smell. If you have any of these symptoms, please speak
      to your doctor or midwife, as this may be a sign of a vaginal infection called
      thrush. Thrush is a yeast infection caused by the fungus Candida albicans. This
      fungus commonly lives in the vagina, but doesn't cause problems unless it starts
      growing too fast. \n These ideas may help to relieve your symptoms- \n apply
      a cold compress to the itchy, inflamed area \n eat natural yoghurt that contains
      cultures such as acidophilus and bifidus - these cultures help to restore the
      balance of 'good' bacteria in your vagina and stop the overgrowth of thrush
      \n wear cotton underwear.
  utter_varicose_veins:
  - text: Varicose veins usually appear as swollen, knotty, bluish veins that may
      develop on your legs during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones are thought to make
      you more likely to develop these veins. \n These steps may help to prevent varicose
      veins from developing (or at least not as badly) and will help to relieve the
      aching that often happens- \n Avoid standing for long periods \n Avoid crossing
      your legs \n Rest with your feet and legs higher than the rest of your body
      \n Do gentle, regular exercise such as walking or swimming \n Wear supportive
      stockings or pantyhose.
  utter_venthouse:
  - text: Ventouse is a suction cup that fits on the baby's head and is sometimes
      used instead of obstetric forceps. It is used in a similar way to forceps, to
      guide the baby through the birth canal. When ventouse is used, the baby may
      have a soft tissue swelling for a few days where the cup was.

  utter_week_1:
  - text: During week 1 of your pregnancy, your baby doesn't weight yet. Your baby
      has yet to be conceived. This week the groundwork is laid for the big O — ovulation
      — the all important first step toward the making of the baby of your dreams.
      And like those dreams, the baby action is all in your head right now — where
      the hypothalamus, the control center in your brain, works with its partner in
      reproduction, the pituitary gland, to start releasing hormones.These hormones
      — called FSH and LH — prompt the ovaries to get cracking on some eggs, ripening
      one to maturity within its follicle. All this egg action causes the ovaries
      to crank up production of two other powerful hormones, estrogen and progesterone.
      These hormones, the dynamic duo of the reproductive system, get the reproductive
      party in your uterus started, telling the uterus to thicken its lining, forming
      a blood-pumped cushion in anticipation of hosting a fertilized egg. Midway through
      your menstrual cycle — around day 14 if you have an average 28-day cycle — the
      dominant follicle in the ovary swells and then ruptures, releasing the mature
      egg of the month. That egg, the one with your baby’s name on it, bursts through
      the walls of the ovary and is immediately swept up into the fringed opening
      of the fallopian tube, where it will take a six day odyssey down to the uterus.
      Ovulation has just occurred.Meanwhile, swimming along as fast as their little
      tails can flutter, millions of sperm are making a beeline for that egg, up through
      the cervix, into the uterus, and then on to the fallopian tube. One especially
      persistent suitor survives the grueling journey to intercept the egg and burrow
      into its outer layers. The victorious sperm plunges into the egg’s nucleus,
      releases its own genetic contribution, and bingo! the egg is officially fertilized.
      That twinkle in your eyes is about to become…a baby.
  utter_week_10:
  - text: During week 10 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 1.25 - 1.5 in. Your
      baby is as big as a prune. Your baby’s growing by leaps and bounds and is already
      an inch and a half long and a quarter ounce in weight. That’s about the size
      of a prune — but happily your sweet sugarplum is much cuter than your average
      prune… and not nearly as wrinkled. Baby’s head takes up about half his length,
      and your cutie’s facial features are quite recognizable now.His eyes are hidden
      behind sealed lids and won’t function until later in the second trimester. But
      a kissable button nose is visible and the external parts of those adorable ears
      have started to grow low down on the fetal head. Twenty tiny baby-teeth buds
      are in place beneath his gums, though you won’t see any precious pearlies until
      your sweetie is about six months old.Baby’s stomach and kidneys are operational
      now, churning out digestive juices and urine. That beating heart is now a fully
      functional four-chambered one- two ventricles pump blood to the lungs and body
      while the two atria receive blood from baby’s circulation. Your baby is also
      getting stronger, busy building bones and cartilage and already sporting a pair
      of elbows that actually bend. Also under construction- knees, wrists, and ankles
      so he can poke and prod his mama in the months to come.If your baby’s a girl,
      her tiny ovaries are beginning to form even tinier eggs. Got a boy in your belly?
      Believe it or not, his newly developing testes are already starting to make
      testosterone. What a guy!
  utter_week_11:
  - text: During week 11 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 1.5 in, 0.25 oz. Your
      baby is as big as a large strawberry. Ladies and gentleman, mommies and daddies…in
      this corner, weighing in at a whopping third of an ounce and standing — or rather,
      laying — two inches long is…your baby! She’s caterpillar-size right now, though
      not quite as fuzzy… and certainly more human in appearance.Sure, her forehead
      is still high, and her head is still disproportionately larger than her body,
      but her facial bones are completely formed, she has an obvious jawline, and
      most of her soon-to-be-adorable facial features are well defined. The ears are
      now sculpted into their seashell shape, hair follicles are sprouting head to
      toe, nipples on the chest are visible, fingernail and toenail beds are developing,
      her skin is beginning to thicken, and those diminutive digits are no longer
      webbed like a froglet’s. And behind those little lips, your baby is trying out
      her new tongue and palate — yawning, swallowing, chewing — prepping for hours
      of eating and chatting in years to come.Your little one’s ticker is ticking
      faster each week — clocking in at about 120 to 160 beats per minute. And while
      you probably don’t feel anything yet, there’s plenty of nimble action going
      on in your uterus. Your tiny athlete is practicing somersaults, stretches, and
      spins…a big workout for one so wee. Lucky for her, your uterine gym is open
      24 hours a day.
  utter_week_12:
  - text: During week 12 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 2 - 2.25 in, 0.5 oz.
      Your baby is as big as a lime. It’s a landmark week for your little one, since
      most of his key body systems and vital organs are fully formed by now. Your
      baby will spend the rest of his gestation bringing those systems up to speed
      and full maturation so they’ll be able to function to perfection once his big
      birth-day arrives.Your fetus can now boast the achievement of having more than
      doubled in size in just three weeks. Crown-to-rump length is about two and a
      half inches, so he’s about the size of a kiwi, but weighs a lot less — just
      half an ounce. A fair amount of heft is in that crown- basic brain structure
      is complete and now it’s time for that brain mass to rapidly increase.Your baby’s
      thyroid is now fully formed, the pituitary gland has started producing hormones,
      and the pancreas has begun to synthesize insulin. Not to be outdone, your baby’s
      bone marrow is churning out white blood cells, the critical weapons needed to
      fight infection once your little warrior is on the outside and no longer protected
      by your immune system.Muscles in the digestive tract are getting primed, practicing
      their contractions so they can process food…and lots and lots of poop…after
      birth. And even though much of the small intestines are still folded up in storage
      in the umbilical cord, the villi — tiny, finger-like projections that absorb
      nutrients from food — are now in place.The best development of all? If you haven’t
      already heard it, this is the week that your cutie’s heartbeat will come through
      loud and clear at your checkup. And that’ll music to your ears.
  utter_week_13:
  - text: During week 13 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 3 in, 1 oz. Your baby
      is as big as a lemon. Your sweet fetus has grown to three inches long — about
      the size of a sweet Georgia peach — and now her little body is poised to begin
      growing at lightning speed. What’s the rush? Well, it’s got to catch up to that
      noggin, which makes up half of your baby’s body size at this point. And catch
      up it will. By the time your little star makes her grand entrance, that head
      will be only one-fourth the size of her body. More big progress this week- The
      intestines complete their move out of their storage space in the umbilical cord
      and into their permanent home in baby’s belly. To nourish that tiny tummy and
      the other systems and organs that are growing like crazy, baby’s lifeline —
      the placenta — is expanding. It weighs just an ounce now, but at birth it’ll
      tip the scale at a full two pounds! That’ll sure help to explain your blossoming
      belly in the weeks to come. There are plenty of subtle changes happening this
      week as well- fingernails and downy hair on the body continue to make their
      appearance. Baby’s bones continue to harden. And those genitals begin to take
      on their gender characteristics, but it’s still too early to tell by looking
      whether you’ve got a bouncing baby boy or girl inside.The muscles of the chest
      wall are starting to develop, and though she’s nowhere near ready to breathe,
      she’s already practicing up with little breathing movements. And long before
      baby says her first “mama” or “dada,” her vocal cords are forming, gearing up
      for that very anticipated first cry…the first of many, that is!
  utter_week_14:
  - text: During week 14 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 3.5 - 4 in, 2 oz. Your
      baby is as big as a navel orange. This week your tiny dancer trades in the sudden
      jerky reflexive movements of last trimester for smoother, more fluid moves.
      Think more ballet and less hip hop. In just a month or two, you’ll get to experience
      those tiny dance steps for yourself, in the form of those very first flutters!
      Baby’s posture is improving, too — his neck is getting longer and his head more
      upright. He may still be the size of a fist, but he’s not shaped like one anymore.There’s
      another important development afoot as your little Sasquatch sprouts hair not
      just on his head but all over his itty-bitty body. Called lanugo, this downy
      coating covers the fetus, primarily to keep him cozy and warm until he packs
      on a few pounds. Once he accumulates some insulating fat and fills out over
      the next few months, most of the lanugo will shed. But don’t be surprised if
      your honey’s still kind of hairy at birth, especially if he arrives early. The
      real locks that are growing on top of his cute head will stay put, though hair
      color may change right up to birth. Underneath that emerging head of hair is
      your baby’s rapidly growing brain. As those amazing cells multiply, the brain
      develops into two distinct halves — the left and right hemisphere. Each one
      controls the opposite side of the body...so if you see your little one sucking
      his right thumb — something he can do now — it’s the left side of his remarkable
      brain telling him how to do it.And thanks to all that new brain power, your
      baby has started developing reflexes. If you were to poke your belly, for instance,
      your little wiggle worm will wriggle away from the intruding finger. If a loud
      noise shakes the comfy confines of his restful roost your little chicken will
      actually startle. Talk about reflexes at work!
  utter_week_15:
  - text: During week 15 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 4 in, 2.5 oz. Your baby
      is as big as a pear. Remember way back to week ten when your little sugarplum
      was the size of a prune and your uterus was the size of an orange? Now, just
      five weeks later, your not-so-little fetus is the size of an orange himself…and
      your uterus is a whole lot bigger, too, which explains the teensy baby bump
      you may be starting to sport. This week your baby is tipping the scales at just
      over two ounces and is around four and a half inches long. Amazingly, he’ll
      double in size over the next few weeks, so be prepared to do some growing of
      your own in the weeks to come. Meanwhile, there’s plenty of action going on
      inside that womb cocoon. The all-important placenta still acts as your baby’s
      kidney — controlling the fluid balance in his tiny body and shuttling waste
      products out into your system — but the fetus’s urinary system is now sufficiently
      developed to produce tiny amounts of pee. And we’re talking tiny…not more than
      a teaspoon of fluid. Still, his teeny tiny bladder fills and empties every 30
      minutes, practicing for the diaper-filling days ahead. Other developments down
      under- The swelling between your baby’s legs, which starts out life as the same
      indistinguishable tube of tissue, is developing into either recognizable boy
      parts or girl parts, aka a penis or clitoris. Good news if you’re looking forward
      to confirming your dreams of baby blue…or pink — though it will be a week or
      two or even more before an ultrasound will reveal your little one’s gender with
      any certainty.In other breaking gender news, if it’s a girl, her ovaries are
      fully formed and are making their trek from the abdomen into the pelvis. Hundreds
      of thousands of eggs are developing within those ovaries, hoping one day to
      turn into fetuses themselves — your grandchildren! Got male? If your baby is
      a boy, his testes are now fully formed as well. More good news- Your little
      one is starting to look less like an alien and more like the baby you’ve been
      dreaming of. His ears have finally found their way up from the neck to their
      proper position. Eyebrows are starting to develop. And baby’s eyes are moving
      from the side of the head to the front of the face — more Rembrandt, less Picasso.
      He’s a masterpiece in the making!
  utter_week_16:
  - text: During week 16 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 4 - 5 in, 3 - 4 oz.
      Your baby is as big as an avocado. What’s going on inside your ever-expanding
      belly this week? For one thing, your little boxer is working up to fighting
      weight. Sure, her body still looks pretty thin and fragile — especially with
      only a translucent layer of skin covering those blood vessels and bones. And
      yes, she’s only four to five inches long and weighs just three ounces. But your
      little flyweight is starting to gain some muscle mass. Her back muscles are
      getting stronger, enabling her to straighten her head and neck even more. Stronger
      muscles also allow her to make some of her very first facial expressions. Was
      that a grin?Talking about that getting-more-adorable-by-the-day face, your baby’s
      eyes are facing fully forward and framed by a fringe of eyelashes and tiny eyebrows.
      And though her eyelids are still sealed shut and will stay that way for another
      ten weeks or so, those tiny orbs will soon be able to perceive light…even though
      there’s nothing to see. It’s always dark, after all, in baby’s hotel womb.In
      other news, your little one’s ticker is pumping around 25 quarts of blood per
      day through her growing body. That sounds like a lot of pumping action going
      on, but it’s only the beginning. By the time your baby is ready for her debut,
      her heart will be pumping 1,900 quarts a day!
  utter_week_17:
  - text: During week 17 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 5 in, 5 oz. Your baby
      is as big as a large onion. Hey Mom…It might be time for a high-five, because
      that’s how big your baby is this week — the size of your open palm. At a less-than-whopping
      three and a half ounces, your little one is starting to layer on some body fat,
      though she’s got a long way to go before she’s anywhere approaching plump.From
      here on out your baby will accumulate fat until it makes up about one-third
      of her weight. That means by the time she makes her big debut, this skinny Minnie
      will be a relatively chubby cherub. But she’s not all lightweight. This week
      marks the first time your baby is bigger in size than the placenta that’s nourishing
      her. Now that’s something to brag about!In other news, baby’s feisty little
      ticker is going full speed ahead thanks to another development this week. Until
      now, your wee one’s heartbeat was spontaneous and irregular. Now, her brain
      is in the driver’s seat, regulating her heart rate to 140 or 150 beats per minute.
      Take a listen — that steady sound will make your own heart sing.Regularity is
      the name of the game these days as your precocious pupil is hard at work honing
      some key skills for her big debut. That includes making up and down movements
      of the chest wall in preparation for breathing actual air when the time comes.
      Sucking and swallowing sessions also make up a good part of her daily schedule
      now — and that’s a good thing. This way she won’t miss a beat when it’s time
      for that first delicious mom-made meal.
  utter_week_18:
  - text: During week 18 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 5.5 in, 5 - 6.5 oz.
      Your baby is as big as a cucumber. At 18 weeks, your little chick is about the
      same size as that chicken breast on your dinner plate — about five inches long
      and five ounces in weight.But don’t let his small size fool you — there are
      big goings-on in that little body of his this week. Meconium — your baby’s first
      poop — is slowly starting to accumulate in his bowels. If your baby’s a boy,
      his prostate gland is forming. And both girl and boy babies now officially sport
      finger and toe prints. Those tiny swirls and wrinkles mark your baby as uniquely
      himself from here on out… though there’s probably little need to tell you how
      especially unique your baby is!Under major construction now is your baby’s nervous
      system. That’s the network that coordinates your cutie’s every move. Right now
      your baby’s brain, spinal cord, and nerves get a boost from myelin, a substance
      that coats the nerves and speeds up the time it takes for messages to travel
      between nerve cells.Myelin also helps baby’s nerves form more complex connections,
      enabling your teeny mover and shaker to perfect more intricate moves such as
      sucking a thumb, clasping hands, and curling his fingers around the umbilical
      cord.And guess what, momma! Somebody’s listening to you. Baby’s ears have arrived
      at their final destination — the sides of his head — and the tiny bones inside
      the inner ear have hardened, allowing your baby to hear some sounds, including
      the sweet sound of your voice! Now hear this- thanks to all the time they spend
      listening to it in utero, studies show that babies are able to identify their
      mom’s voice right after birth. Keep that in mind the next time you serenade
      your womb with your lullabies…or rock out in the shower. Your little one is
      all ears!
  utter_week_19:
  - text: During week 19 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 6 in, 8 oz. Your baby
      is as big as a mango. At half a pound and six inches long, your baby is about
      the size of a juicy mango. And that’s pretty sweet!On the development docket
      this week- a total baby body wrap. Your little one gets a head-to-toe coating
      of vernix caseosa, a white cheesy-looking substance made up of lanugo (that
      downy hair), oil from his glands, and dead skin cells. Maybe not a recipe for
      your favorite spa treatment, but just the right one for your fetus.This waterproof
      mixture protects your baby’s skin from his 24/7 bath — the amniotic fluid —
      and lubricates the birth canal. Without it, baby would look positively prune-y
      at birth and would have a much tougher time getting out the door. Don’t be surprised
      if you see vernix remnants on your newborn right after delivery, especially
      if he makes an early debut.On the looks side, your baby’s monkey-like appearance
      of yester-week is yesterday’s news now that his legs have gone through a growth
      spurt and are finally in proportion to his arms. Those longer legs, coupled
      with the strengthening of cartilage into bone, will make your little one’s kicks
      and jabs more powerful.Add to that the newly-formed neurons that are sending
      better commanding messages from the brain to the muscles and you’ve got a formula
      for stronger, meaner, and more controlled movements, allowing your acrobat to
      take his body for some serious test-drives — and for you to start feeling them.
      In the coming weeks you’ll experience plenty of flutters, kicks, jabs, twists,
      stretches, and punches. And no matter when you begin feeling them or what they
      feel like, all your baby’s movements are bound to be moving.
  utter_week_20:
  - text: During week 20 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 6.5 in, 10 oz. Your
      baby is as big as a sweet potato. Even though your baby is still teensy — just
      over six inches long and about ten ounces in weight — week 20 is huge. Why?
      Well, for one thing you’re halfway through your pregnancy… and baby is halfway
      ready to meet you! This is also a big week if you've been waiting — and waiting
      and waiting — to find out whether that cantaloupe in your belly is a sweet boy
      or girl.The time has come for the big reveal, since a second trimester ultrasound
      can now deliver the definitive news. Want to keep playing the guessing game?
      Make sure you tell your practitioner and the ultrasound technician that mum’s
      the word — and that you’d rather they didn't spill the baby gender beans.If
      you’re carrying a girl, her external genitals may not be as prominent as a boy’s
      (when are they ever?), but they are clearly delineated at this age. And they’re
      just the tip of the iceberg. Inside your little girl’s body is a fully formed
      uterus … in miniature. Her tiny ovaries contain the millions of eggs she’ll
      be born with, and her vagina is beginning to hollow out.If you’re bearing a
      boy, the evidence pops up on like a flag in a stiff breeze on the ultrasound.
      Even at this tender age, the family jewels are there for all to admire. Well,
      one of them anyway — the testicles haven’t descended from the abdomen, yet.
      They’re just waiting for the scrotum to finish construction so they’ll have
      a home to move into in just a few weeks.Meanwhile, your baby is starting the
      process of plumping up, as new fat gets deposited under the skin. Most of the
      fat is called brown fat and is designed to keep baby warm until your little
      one’s internal temperature regulatory system kicks into gear after birth. The
      white fat, the kind that’ll really fill baby up and is responsible for those
      pinchable cheeks and roly-poly thighs, doesn’t make its appearance in large
      quantities for a few more weeks. Which means baby will stay slender…and somewhat
      wrinkly…for now.
  utter_week_21:
  - text: During week 21 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 10.5 in, 11 - 12.5 oz.
      Your baby is as big as a large banana. It’s week 21 and your little monkey is
      about the size of a medium banana — around 7 inches long and almost three-quarters
      of a pound. As he gets bigger and bigger, you’ll be able to feel those movements
      more and more…at least when he’s not hunkering down for one of his many naps.
      Naps? Yup. Though it may not feel like it with all the kicking and poking going
      on in there, your snoozer sleeps as much as 14 hours a day.But not because it’s
      boring at Hotel Uterus. On the contrary- You keep things very interesting simply
      by switching up the catering menu. Those teensy taste buds on his tiny tongue
      are now developed enough so while he can’t actually eat the foods you do, he
      can taste them in the amniotic fluid.And taste them he will as he gulps several
      ounces each day for hydration and nutrition…and to practice swallowing and digesting.
      So sup on something spicy and within an hour or two it’ll feel like a dance
      party in your belly as your budding baby burrito gets a hint of that enchilada.
      Savor some scampi, and your little shrimp will catch a wave of garlic.Need another
      reason to add variety to your second and third trimester menus? Studies show
      that babies who have sampled certain foods while in utero are more inclined
      to eat them once they hit the high chair. So putting broccoli, carrots, and
      kale on your plate now packs a one-two punch- great nutrition for you and your
      baby, and a greater likelihood your potentially picky eater will savor those
      veggies later on.
  utter_week_22:
  - text: During week 22 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 11 in, 1 lb. Your baby
      is as big as a red bell pepper. Your baby hits a mini milestone this week. At
      a full pound, she bids bye-bye to postal-scale weigh-ins and graduates to the
      real thing. And at almost 8 inches, your little bear is about the size of the
      teddies she’ll be playing with before you know it.A lot has to happen before
      then, of course, but things are moving along at a brisk pace. Your baby’s quickly
      developing nervous system is sharpening her senses more and more each day, putting
      her in touch with her world and her own body. In fact, a new-found sense of
      touch is making things a lot more fascinating in her cozy domain as tiny fingers
      reach out to explore tiny toes and — what’s that? — my nose and my ears!Those
      same fidgety digits feel their way along the uterine walls, grasping onto the
      branch-like umbilical cord with all their might. Your wee one is already working
      on the strong grip she’ll use to grab onto your finger when she’s a newborn.Your
      baby’s sense of sight is also coming into focus. What can she see at this point?
      Even though it’s dark inside your tummy and her eyelids are still fused shut,
      your baby can perceive light when you let the sun (or a flashlight) shine on
      your belly. Her sufficiently developed cochlear membranes in the ears are tuned
      up to hear and process sounds from inside your body. What’s your little one
      listening to now? Your breathing, the whoosh of your blood flow, your rumbling
      tummy, and of course the pitter-pattering of your heartbeat.
  utter_week_23:
  - text: During week 23 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 11 in, 1.2 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a grapefruit. At around 8 inches long and a smidge over a
      pound, your little pup is actually looking a bit like a shar-pei — very cute,
      but still very wrinkly. Poised to put on pounds, baby’s birthday suit has outpaced
      the fat that’ll start to accumulate very soon. As a result, saggy skin hangs
      loosely from those little limbs like long-johns that are two sizes too big.Your
      baby’s skin is also cellophane thin and has taken on a reddish cast, thanks
      to the vivid network of blood vessels developing underneath. Right now, it’s
      a look only a mother…or father…could love. Luckily, a tough, protective protein,
      called keratin, is being added to your baby’s skin cells, and that’ll thicken
      his skin as he continues to gestate in your cozy uterus. Don’t worry, his skin
      will be soft, sweet, and suitable for stroking by the time he checks out of
      Motel Mommy, and checks into your arms.But before he’s ready to face the world
      outside, he’s going to have to be able to breath in it — and for that important
      function to function, his lungs will have some maturing to do. Right now, the
      maturation process is beginning — though it’ll be a while before those tiny
      lungs will be ready for the breathing big time. Small capillaries are forming
      in the lungs and specialized lung cells, called pneumocytes, are developing.
      These all important cells will produce surfactant down the road — the crucial
      substance that’ll help baby’s lungs expand after birth. But more about that
      later.In the meantime, take a look at that amazing placenta — your baby’s recently
      completed life support system. The pancake-shaped placenta — attached to your
      uterine wall and connected to your growing baby by the umbilical cord — acts
      as a sophisticated trading post and filtering system, transferring oxygen and
      nutrients to your fetus, and removing waste products.It also protects your baby,
      serving as a sort of fetal security checkpoint, by preventing harmful substances
      and infections from passing from your system into your baby’s. And as if that’s
      not enough to dazzle you, the placenta is also hard at work producing hormones
      — estrogen and progesterone — that keep your pregnancy going strong. Pretty
      impressive for a network of blood vessels!
  utter_week_24:
  - text: During week 24 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 11.5 in, 1.3 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a pomegranate. She’s still just a hair over 8 inches long
      and weighs just a pound and a half, but this week your baby is starting to look
      much more like the cuddly cutie you've been picturing in your mind’s eye. Granted,
      her mini mug has some filling out to do, as does the rest of her slender silhouette,
      but as she accumulates more muscle and fat, she’ll plump up nicely.And here's
      another benefit to her rounding out. Once your skinny-minnie puts on more subcutaneous
      fat, her now translucent skin will become opaque. In other words, you won’t
      be able to see right through her birthday suit to her organs, bones, and veins
      like you could now…that is, if you had a window on your womb.Is she ready for
      her close-up? Almost. She’s still sporting bright white eyelashes, eyebrows,
      and hair, all of which have yet to acquire pigment. When they change to brown,
      red, black or blonde, you’ll have your very own cover girl. And here’s a breaking
      brain bulletin- If you were to measure your little one’s brain wave activity
      you’d see that it’s similar to that of a newborn infant. Wondering what that
      means? Those brains cells have matured enough to develop conscious thought and,
      most probably, memory.Couple that with her amped up auditory system and it’s
      no wonder that babies who hear certain musical pieces while in utero recognize
      — and are calmed — by that same music when they’re born. So crank up the Beethoven,
      Beatles, or Black Eyed Peas…your baby’s sure to get her groove on — now and
      later!
  utter_week_25:
  - text: During week 25 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 13 in, 1.5 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as an eggplant. At 25 weeks your uterus is about the size of
      a soccer ball, a fact that’s probably pretty apparent if you’re still trying
      to zip your old jeans. Bouncing around inside that ball is your bouncing baby
      boy or girl, now nine inches long and topping a pound and a half. Your little
      kicker will be making his presence known quite vigorously for the next three
      weeks, his most active time in the whole pregnancy.If your womb had a view,
      you’d see that your sweetie’s skin has taken on a pinkish hue — a sign that
      the fetal vascular system is maturing. More and more capillaries filled with
      blood are forming under the skin and in those developing air sacs in your baby’s
      fledgling lungs.Surfactant — an anti-stick substance that’ll help the lungs
      expand with air once they’re outside the womb — is starting to form, too, getting
      baby ready for his first gulp of fresh air (not to mention his first squall).
      On a related front — and located right on the front of that adorable little
      face — are your baby’s tiny nostrils. They’ve been closed until now, but this
      week they celebrate their grand opening, allowing your baby to go through the
      motions of inhaling and exhaling.Right now there’s no air to breathe, of course,
      so instead baby draws amniotic fluid in and out of those petite nostrils. These
      breathing practice runs might seem silly when there’s no air around, but it’s
      well worth the effort, because when it comes to breathing, practice makes perfect.
  utter_week_26:
  - text: During week 26 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 14 in, 2 lbs. Your baby
      is as big as an acorn squash. At two pounds and nine inches long, your little
      nestling is having an eye-opening week. Until now, his fetal eyes were under
      wraps, quietly developing beneath fused eyelids. But now it’s time for the big
      reveal as his eensy optic orbs open … and blink. Of course, these newbie peepers
      are just learning to focus… plus, there’s not much to see in the murk of his
      cozy confines. Still, it’s a big milestone…and important practice for the moment
      when your little one’s eyes and yours lock for the first time.Wondering if you’ll
      be looking into baby blues…or greens…or browns? Right now the irises are still
      pretty pale. Pigmentation comes in over the next few months — and even at birth,
      eye color is often in transition. It may not be clear if you've got a green-,
      blue- or brown-eyed honey until he’s at least six months old.Your baby’s first
      blinks of an eye may be adorable, but they’re also a very important developmental
      step. Blinking is a skill that’s essential in the outside world because it lubricates
      the eyes and protects them from foreign objects — including your little one’s
      own wayward fingers.Looking a little lower on that adorable face, nerves around
      that bow-shaped mouth and lips are getting a lot more sensitive now, prepping
      baby for the all-important task of honing in on mom’s nipple once he’s born.
      Already, he’ll try to mouth whatever comes near those lips…including the umbilical
      cord.And high inside that mouth — higher up in the gums than those baby teeth
      buds that developed earlier — are the first inklings of permanent teeth. Right
      now they’re just tiny buds, and they've got a lot of hibernating to do before
      they’re ready to poke out, but in six or so years they’ll grow into pearly whites
      that’ll last your little one his whole life.In other development news, your
      maturing baby is better coordinated now — especially when it comes to his hands.
      He can easily make a fist, suck his thumb, clasp his hands together, and even
      play with his toes. Can’t wait until you’ll be able to play with his tiny digits
      yourself? Why not start some baby games now with some poking play? Try returning
      his pokes with your own gentle prodding through your belly. You’ll both get
      a kick out of that.
  utter_week_27:
  - text: During week 27 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 14.5 in, 2 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a cabbage. This week marks the end of the second trimester
      — which means you’re two thirds of the way there, mama! But you’re not the only
      one who’s come a long way…your baby has, too. Now tipping the scales at over
      two pounds, your wonderful work-in-progress has doubled in weight in the past
      month. (Better her than you, right?)What’s new in the height department? Actually,
      a whole lot — including how that height is calculated. Those crown-to-rump measurements
      are now officially being traded in for the easier-to-picture head-to-heel measurement.
      So how tall is your ever-bigger baby bun at the dawning of the third trimester?
      A full 15 inches — more than a foot long!What’s on baby’s menu these days? Lots
      and lots of amniotic fluid, which your little gourmand ingests in large quantities.
      Around a pint of amniotic fluid passes through baby’s digestive system per day,
      into her now fully functioning kidneys, and back out into the amniotic fluid
      as urine…and this ingestion-excretion cycle happens every three hours.By the
      way, the amniotic fluid also serves as a two-way radio, thanks to the conductivity
      of fluid. You already know your little listener can hear your voices, but it
      goes the other way, too. If your partner patiently presses his ear to your belly,
      he may be able to hear that most precious sound of all — the thumpety-thump
      of your little one’s heartbeat.
  utter_week_28:
  - text: During week 28 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 15 in, 2.25 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a head of lettuce. It’s week 28 and from here on out there
      will start to be small differences in the rate of growth depending on your whether
      your baby-to-be is a boy or girl — a bouncing blue bruiser is likely to grow
      bigger and heavier than a princess playing on team pink. Genetics and other
      factors also weigh on how fast a baby grows and how big she will ultimately
      be on arrival.So while on average, a 28-weeker is around two and a half pounds
      and almost 16 inches tall, your little one may currently be longer, shorter,
      heavier, or less tubby. As long she continues to get good reports at those prenatal
      checkups, you can rest assured your baby’s on the right track and in the right
      range for growth.Your minute miracle has added another trick to her repertoire…hiccupping.
      If you haven’t yet, you’ll not only be able to feel hiccups on the inside, as
      little rhythmic twitches — you’ll be seeing them on the outside, too, making
      your belly shake like a bowl of jelly. These tiny spasms are thought to be caused
      by the sudden, irregular contraction of the immature diaphragm, which is still
      trying to gear up for life outside the womb by practicing the ins and outs of
      breathing.Some babies hiccup several times a day every day, others not so much
      — but you’re bound to feel those adorable twitches every so often — and an ultrasound
      might pick that little chest heaving from the hiccups, too. Entertaining for
      you, and happily, not uncomfortable for baby. Another activity that can be picked
      up- REM or rapid eye movement. Those tiny flutters of baby’s eyes suggests that
      she’s is dreaming away, since REM is considered the “dream” phase of sleep —
      but there’s no way of knowing what’s on your little one’s mind — or what, if
      anything, she might be dreaming of. What we do know is that sleep cycles are
      coming at more regular times… meaning that your sweet sleepyhead is developing
      a more regular pattern of sleeping and wakefulness.Problem is, your on-the-go
      movements lull her to sleep during the day, keeping her awake and raring to
      go just when you’re settling down for the night. Still, there’s nothing more
      satisfying than feeling your amazing miracle summersault and stretch inside
      of you. Plus, as they say, baby’s keeping you up with those antics now is good
      preparation for after she’s born…and when every night’s a night to howl.Want
      more satisfaction? Though the bun in your oven is far from being fully baked,
      her chances of survival outside the womb are at least 90 percent at this point.
  utter_week_29:
  - text: During week 29 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 15.5 -16 in, 2.5 - 3
      lbs. Your baby is as big as a head of cauliflower. Your sweet sapling is getting
      taller by the week, topping 16 inches about now. But at less than 3 pounds,
      this kid isn’t going to win any chubby-cheek awards just yet. Not to worry…the
      big weight gain period is just ahead. By the time the curtain rises on your
      baby-to-be, he’ll be more than double — and maybe even triple — his weight right
      now.Where will all that weight come from? From the new white fat that’s starting
      to form beneath his skin. Unlike the brown fat he acquired as a fledgling fetus
      — the kind that was necessary for body temperature regulation — this white fat
      provides energy as well as girth to your growing baby. And thanks to that energy
      boost, your baby is mightier than ever — those stronger pokes and kicks prove
      it...even as your little Rocky or Rockette has less room in your increasingly
      cramped studio space.Speaking of kicks, doing a twice-daily kick count is one
      way to make sure your baby’s on track. Just lie down on your left side (after
      a snack if possible) and start counting. Ten movements of any kind in an hour
      are what you’re looking for. Flutters, rolls, jabs, and hiccups count. Once
      you’ve hit ten, don’t just lie there…take a nap — you’ve earned it.
  utter_week_3:
  - text: During week 3 of your pregnancy, your baby weights Baby's super tiny. Your
      baby is as big as a vanilla bean seed. Congratulations — you've conceived! One
      tenacious little sperm ran the gauntlet, penetrated your ready egg, and presto
      — you’re pregnant. Your soon-to-be baby has started its miraculous transformation
      from single cell to fully formed baby boy or girl ready for cuddles and kisses.Within
      a matter of hours after conception, the fertilized egg — called a zygote — divides
      into two, then splits again and again. Seventy-two hours after fertilization
      your little zygote has become a ball of sixteen cells. This microscopic globe
      is called a morula, Latin for mulberry. And if you think about it, that ball
      of cells does look a berry — a cute little berry that you’ll soon be calling
      baby.Over the next few days, the morula continues to drift down your fallopian
      tube, dividing into a blastocyst — a cluster of cells numbering nearly a hundred
      strong. Its final destination- your uterus, which it’ll call home for the next
      nine months as it morphs from blastocyst to embryo to fetus to… baby!Amazingly,
      the blastocyst already has two distinct cell types. First, there’s the outer
      trophoblast cells. They’ll become the placenta — your baby’s lifeline during
      his stay in your uterine cocoon. The second type of cells is called the embryoblast.
      This inner cell mass will eventually develop into your baby. Hard to believe
      — huh?Though it’ll be a while before you’re able to tell whether your tiny blob
      of cells is a boy blob or a girl blob, its gender has already been determined
      by Dad (or actually by his chromosomes). Mom always supplies an X chromosome,
      but the proud papa provides either an X or a Y chromosome. Two Xs make a girl.
      An X plus a Y makes a boy. In a few months you’ll be able to find out what winning
      letter combination you have growing inside of you.

      is as big as a bunch of broccoli. Big changes are underway in your baby’s watery
      world this week. At about 3 pounds and still about 16 inches long, your little
      chick is starting to look more like a cherub as she continues plumping up. She’ll
      be piling on weight at the rate of about half pound a week from here on out.
      Remember the lanugo — the downy blanket of body hair she’s been wearing for
      warmth? Now that your little one’s got more fat to keep her toasty, she’s able
      to start shedding her fuzz — which means your bear will no longer be fuzzy wuzzy
      by the time she arrives. Other cuter pursuits on the agenda- growing thicker
      eyelashes, eyebrows, and hair on her head…that is unless she’s destined to be
      a beautiful baldy.But perhaps the biggest bulletin comes from your baby’s brain,
      which is getting ready to kick up its capacity. Once smooth, it’s now forming
      channels and creases, creating more brain tissue with greater surface area.
      Without this new topography, that neonatal noodle would become enormous, and
      of course, so would your baby’s head. The result is a top-heavy baby unable
      to fit through the birth canal… ouch.The creases and indentations also allow
      for future expansion of brain tissue that is crucial as your baby goes from
      helpless newborn to responsive infant to verbal toddler to curious preschooler
      and beyond. Another big change this week is that baby’s bone marrow has stepped
      up to the plate, taking over the job of producing red blood cells from the pinch
      hitters, the spleen and tissue groups. These red blood cells are critical because
      they transport oxygen and remove waste. With their help, your baby begins prepping
      for the future, by storing iron, calcium and phosphorus in those tiny cells.
  utter_week_31:
  - text: During week 31 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 16 in, 3.2 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a coconut. This week your baby finally comes to his senses.
      That’s right, all five senses are now operational. Even though your little one
      is just over three pounds and only 16 to 18 inches long, he’s now prepared to
      fully experience the world that waits just outside his quiet cocoon.His eyes
      can now perceive light with fully functioning irises that dilate and contract.
      And those ears, though tiny, not only can hear, they can distinguish sounds.
      Studies show that fetal heart rates actually speed up and slow down in response
      to different music. And while there’s no air underwater for your little minnow
      to breathe in, his nose is ready for smelling.And sniff he does, getting a sense
      of your scent from the amniotic fluid that passes through his nasal passages.
      Once he emerges, those first real inhalations of air will take in your special
      mommy aroma, further imprinting it as the one closest to his heart…and helping
      him feel as at home in your arms as he did in your womb.He’s also exploring
      with his new senses, playing with his nose, toes, umbilical cord, and your uterine
      walls to hone his sense of touch. And by opening his little mouth, and tasting
      and sucking his thumb, he’s getting ready for the good stuff that’ll be coming
      down the pike in just a few short weeks.Now that his brain is processing the
      barrage of signals coming in from his senses, cranial connections are multiplying
      at an astonishing rate. Cerebral development is in high gear and will crank
      along at breakneck speed for the next several weeks, even after your budding
      genius has made his grand entrance.
  utter_week_32:
  - text: During week 32 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 16 - 17 in, 3.5 - 4
      lbs. Your baby is as big as a cantaloupe. At about 4 pounds and 16 to 19 inches
      long, your baby is curled up in, well, the fetal position. After all, there’s
      not much room left at this particular inn. Not to worry, though. She’s totally
      comfy in there — even if you’re not quite comfy out here.As your baby hunkers
      down in your bunker to ride out the last few weeks of gestation, she’s probably
      settling into the most common birthing position- head down, bottom up. Anatomically
      it makes sense — she’s maximizing what little space she has by dropping her
      head into the bottom of your inverted pear-shaped uterus. It’s also natural
      since baby’s bean is heavier than her tiny tush.With only 8 more weeks to go,
      your busy bee is gearing up for life outside the womb. Those breathing movements
      she’s been practicing? Well, they’re almost perfect now, changing from the short
      staccato bursts of only 10 seconds long to a more regular and rhythmic pattern
      that’ll eventually churn out 40 breaths per minute — the normal rate of a newborn.These
      breathing lessons serve another purpose as well, encouraging the lungs to produce
      more surfactant — the protein that’ll help the lungs expand after birth and
      that is essential for healthy lung development.Reinforcements for the monumental
      task of producing surfactant come from another source, too. The adrenal glands,
      located on top of the kidneys, are hard at working starting to pump out cortisol,
      which will in turn help stimulate more surfactant production. These workhorse
      glands are producing 10 times the amount of cortisol a normal adult produces…pretty
      amazing for someone so small!Meanwhile, lanugo is continuing to shed, leaving
      only small patches of fuzz on the shoulders and back. Fingernails have grown
      almost long enough to be in need of a trim, but they’re still pretty soft. Baby
      might not need a mini-manicure just yet, but there’s no reason why you shouldn't
      treat yourself to one while you still have time. A pedicure, too — after all,
      bet you can’t see your toes.
  utter_week_33:

      baby is as big as a butternut squash. It’s week 33 and, as your watermelon-sized
      belly is likely to attest, your baby has come a long way from his poppy-seed
      size status. He seems like a relative heavy weight at four and a half pounds,
      but remember, he could double that weight in the coming weeks. Happily he won’t
      be doubling his height. At around 17 to 19 inches long, your baby is pretty
      close to the length he’ll be at birth.What’s going on in the uterine nursery?
      Well, your fetus is starting to react remarkably like the infant he’ll become.
      Sensitive to the light that penetrates through your now thinner abdominal walls,
      drowsy eyes drift shut to sleep when it’s dark and flicker open when it’s light.
      These are your dozing darling’s first lessons in learning the difference between
      night and day, a distinction that’s obviously important once he’s outside the
      womb.Still playing a crucial role is the amniotic fluid that surrounds your
      floating baby. It’s around one degree warmer than your body temperature, so
      it serves to keep your baby toasty and warm until the big day. Until now, there
      was more amniotic fluid than actual baby in your womb, a ratio that created
      a cushion between you and your little boxer.But now amniotic fluid levels have
      topped out and your baby’s taking up more room in the uterus. The result? There’s
      less elbow room for baby and less of a cushion for mama, meaning those left
      hooks and karate kicks will be more uncomfortable for you.Though your little
      one may be able to throw a mean jab, he’s not quite ready for a prime time bout.
      His body is still busy developing its independent immune system, thanks in large
      part to the antibodies you’re passing along through the placenta. Thanks, mom!

      stand) — about 20 inches in length.Have a boy bun in the oven? Then hooray for
      his testicles, which started out tucked up in his abdomen and are now migrating
      to their permanent home — his scrotum. In about three to four percent of boys,
      the testicles hang out upstairs a while longer, lingering until some lads turn
      a year old. So don’t worry if your son is born with undescended testicles...they’ll
      make an appearance in the near future.Both boy and girl babies are producing
      lots of sex hormones now, which will explain why the genitals may appear large
      and swollen at birth… and in the case of a little man, why the scrotal skin
      may appear darkly pigmented in the first few weeks after birth.In other news,
      with just a few weeks to the big day, vernix — the white waxy coating that protects
      baby’s skin from amniotic fluid and provides lubrication for delivery — is thickening
      right on prepping schedule. Also right on schedule is the maturation of your

      baby is as big as a spaghetti squash. At week 35, your little bundle isn’t so
      little any more. She’s pretty much maxed out in the length department at about
      20 inches. But at five and a half pounds, your bambino still has some ounces
      to gain — and those will pile on quickly. In fact, she’ll likely pack on a whole
      pound or two or more before she heads down the exit ramp.Back in mid-pregnancy
      when baby’s physique was more birdlike than brawny, only two percent of that
      itty-bitty body was fat. Now that percentage has grown to 15 percent, and by
      birth will double to 30 percent. As that all-important insulation distributes
      across her body, your little one’s legs, arms, torso and face are filling out
      nicely. Bye-bye birdie...hello cherub!Fetal brain development is also moving
      at a cracker jack pace…and will continue to do so throughout childhood. In this
      last trimester, your baby’s brain weight increases by almost ten times and by
      age 12, that same brain will be more than three times the size it was at birth.
      Just in time for pre-algebra!As your baby fills out and her uterine confines
      get tighter, her movements will feel less like individual kicks and more like
      slithers and rolls. Don’t be surprised if the contours of your tummy change
      from time to time — it’s not an alien you’re gestating, just your baby shifting
      position!Got twins in the tank? Uterine conditions are getting pretty cramped
      by now, and you should expect to deliver earlier than if you were just carrying
      one baby — in the next couple weeks. In fact — 37 weeks is considered full term
      for twins — so get ready mama!
  utter_week_36:
  - text: During week 36 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 18 - 19 in, 6 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a bunch of kale. Talk about a growth spurt! Your baby has
      gone from the size of a sesame seed to a six-pound, 20-incher in about six months
      time! That incredible rate of growth slows now for two important reasons. First,
      your little one is storing up the energy reserves he’ll need to get through
      labor and enter the world. Plus, if his body got much bigger, he’d have a really
      tough time fitting through the narrow alley of your birth canal...a tight squeeze
      no matter what.Speaking of that journey, it’s a good thing for both of you that
      his bones are still flexible, enabling a gentler ride to the big meet and greet.
      Leading the way is his nifty noggin, featuring ingenious floating skull plates
      that overlap to allow the head to compress on the way out. When your little
      one emerges, you’ll notice a soft rectangular area on the top of his cute little
      head. This soft spot — or anterior fontanel — is where your baby’s skulls bones
      haven’t yet fused. They’ll close by the time he turns 18 months.Final touches
      are making your baby ready for prime time. Blood circulation has been fine-tuned
      and the immune system is set to do battle with germs outside the womb. After
      birth your little fighter will continue to reap the benefits of your antibodies
      thank to your colostrum and breast milk. And speaking of that breast milk, baby’s
      digestive system is ready to accept liquid food — theoretically — since your
      little one still gets all his nutrition (and oxygen) from the placenta.
  utter_week_37:
  - text: During week 37 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 19 in, 6.5 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a canary melon. At week 37, your no-longer little peach is
      ripe and ready — in fact, even if she arrived a tad earlier than expected, she
      wouldn’t be considered premature. Still, she’s smart to stay put — which, like
      most babies, she’s likely to do. With just three more weeks to go inside her
      uterine home, she’ll manage to pack on a pound or more — rounding out frame
      and rounding up her birthweight…happily, without you having to gain another
      ounce.By now it’s likely your soon-to-be-born baby has rotated south to a head-first
      position. Not all babies make this downward turn…about three to four percent
      of fetuses opt to stay stubbornly in the upright — or breech — position. If
      this is your first pregnancy, there’s a chance your little one’s head has or
      will soon drop into your pelvis in a process that’s called engagement — or “lightening”,
      since it lightens the pressure on your long-cramped diaphragm.Engagement also
      means that your little bundle is locked and loaded and in position for departure
      — even if that departure isn’t scheduled for two or more weeks. Baby hasn’t
      dropped yet? Not to worry. She’ll make her way down and out eventually, just
      in her own sweet time. Second babies almost always wait to do their dropping
      until the labor party gets started.Feeling fewer punches and kicks? The fact
      that baby’s dropped is one reason. Her too-squished-to-move quarters is another.
      Or it could be that she’s doing some more regular snoozing — clocking in long
      cycles of twenty to forty minutes of shut-eye. Let’s hope she keeps that up
      once she’s on the outside.What’s keeping her busy while she bides her time before
      D-day? She’s sucking her thumb to practice her nursing skills, brushing up on
      her breathing by inhaling and exhaling amniotic fluid, and blinking to prepare
      to protect her eyes once she’s born. She’s also busy accumulating more fat,
      forming dimples in those cute elbows, knees, and shoulders, and adorable creases
      and folds in the neck and wrists. Bet you can’t wait to kiss those dimples and
      caress those creases! It won’t be long now.
  utter_week_38:
  - text: During week 38 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 19 - 20 in, 7 lbs. Your
      baby is as big as a mini watermelon. At about seven pounds and 21 inches long
      on average, your bun in the oven is now a fully cooked loaf of bread. He’s still
      got some work ahead of him, though, before his big debut. He’ll lose the vernix
      — the waxy coating that’s been protecting his fragile fetal skin from amniotic
      fluid — and he’ll shed any remaining lanugo — the fine hair that was temporarily
      covering his body.Wondering where it all goes? Once the vernix and lanugo are
      shed into the surrounding amniotic fluid your baby ingests them along with other
      waste products such as bile, urine, and old cells. These all percolate in those
      teeny intestines, ultimately winding up in his diaper as the very first, very
      dark green, and very sticky poop known as meconium. Might not be a tasty first
      meal, but it’s pretty efficient!Also gearing up for the big day are your baby’s
      lungs… now fully mature, but still producing surfactant in large quantities
      to ensure that the transition from watery womb to wondrous world is a smooth
      one. Your little diver’s been practicing his breathing moves underwater for
      months and he’s just about ready to try the real thing.As baby prepares for
      life in on the outside, the placenta — his lifeline in this underwater world
      — starts to slowly deteriorate. Not to worry — it still has plenty of life left
      to sustain your little one until the big day.
  utter_week_39:
  - text: During week 39 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 19 - 21 in, 7 - 8 lbs.
      Your baby is as big as a honeydew melon. It’s week 39 and you’re in the homestretch
      now. Good news for your very-stretched out belly — and your larger-than-ever
      baby, since it’s pretty crowded inside there. It helps that your baby’s just
      about done growing, weighing in at 7 or 8 pounds (or maybe even heavier) and
      measuring up at 19 to 21 inches. The only thing still growing up a storm at
      the moment is your little one’s brain, which will continue to develop at a mind-boggling
      rate for the first three years of your smarty-pants’ life. Also in development
      this week- His tear ducts, though they won’t actually produce tears until several
      weeks after birth. So while your newborn will definitely be able to communicate
      his needs by crying — trust me on that — the waterworks won’t start rolling
      down those cheeks for a while. It’ll be all crocodile tears for your little
      gator.And speaking of cheeks, your baby’s are chubbier and more deliciously
      kissable than they were just a short while ago. His skin now has a protective
      fat layer covering the blood vessels across the body, and his formerly translucent
      pink complexion becomes a tad darker as skin pigment starts to develop. No matter
      what skin color your baby will eventually wear, however, your little one will
      be born with a light skin tone until his pigmentation deepens to the color he’s
      destined to be.And on top of his sweet little noggin he might be sporting a
      full head of hair. Or he might be a cutie cue ball. Or somewhere in between.
      But it doesn’t matter much. From head to toe, this just-about-baked baby finally
      resembles the little person you’ll soon come to know and love — and get to hug,
      hug, hug.
  utter_week_4:
  - text: During week 4 of your pregnancy, your baby weights Baby's super tiny. Your
      baby is as big as a poppy seed. It’s implantation time! Now no bigger than a
      poppy seed (though a whole lot sweeter), the ball of cells that will become
      your baby has completed its weeklong voyage down your fallopian tube and has
      claimed its berth in your uterus by tunneling into the sticky uterine lining.
      Nestled in your uterine home, this miniature miracle has established the cozy
      connection that will bind the two of you for the next eight plus months and
      forever after.But that’s just the beginning of the action this week. In the
      works is the amniotic sac that your baby will call home sweet home. And at last!
      … the sign you've been waiting for- your little embryo starts to produce HCG
      — the just-for-pregnancy hormone that’ll turn your pregnancy pee test positively
      positive. You’re officially expecting!Though your embryo is only a tiny dot,
      it has already started to differentiate into three layers, each with its own
      job assignment. The inner layer, called the endoderm, will become the digestive
      system, the liver, pancreas, bladder, and thyroid gland.The middle layer — the
      mesoderm — will grow into the heart, bones, kidneys, muscles, and blood vessels.
      The outer layer, called the ectoderm, will develop into the brain, nervous system,
      skin, hair, and eyes. It’s hard to believe, but by the end of your fourth week
      of pregnancy, all the building blocks for your baby’s vital organs are firmly
      in place.
  utter_week_40:
  - text: During week 40 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 19 - 22 in, 7 - 9 lbs.
      Your baby is as big as a small pumpkin. Congratulations…your baby is officially
      full-term! She’s now between 6 and 9 pounds, and anywhere between 19 and 22
      inches long — a wide range, true, but that’s because babies, like their parents,
      come in all sizes…taller, shorter, chubbier, slimmer. What package will your
      baby come in? It’s hard to say for sure until she arrives — ven your practitioner’s
      guesstimates can be way off the final mark.You know what else is around 20 inches
      long? Your baby’s umbilical cord — her connection to you during her nine-month
      stint in your uterus. It could be floating free in whatever space there’s left
      in your uterus, coiled around her ankle or wrist, gripped between her chubby
      fingers, or wrapped around her neck. Not to worry if it is…it’s not dangerous
      now and at birth your practitioner will simply slip it over her head before
      clamping it tight. The remnants will dry up and become…her sweet little belly
      button.Your little miracle is now fully loaded with fully functioning organs,
      bodily systems, and reflexes, and she’s ready to start her new life outside
      your uterus. When you do meet your new arrival, be sure to say hello — and more.
      Though it’ll be your first face-to-face, your baby will recognize the sound
      of your voice — and that of dad’s.Though your sweetie is fully baked and ready
      to roll, she’s still putting in a full day’s work. Her hormones are revving
      up, sending signals throughout her body to prepare for life on the outside.
      Hopefully one of those hormones will signal to the placenta that it’s time to
      initiate labor.Even during labor and delivery, your little one will be hard
      at work alongside you, producing her own stress hormones that’ll enable her
      to adapt immediately to the new environment outside your womb and kick-start
      the survival instincts she needs as well as help her take her first big breath
      of air.And if she doesn't arrive on time, opting instead for a late checkout,
      you’re in good — though anxious — company. About half of all pregnancies proceed
      past the 40-week mark, though thankfully, your practitioner will probably not
      let yours continue beyond 42 weeks.
  utter_week_41:
  - text: During week 41 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 19 - 22 in, 7 - 9 lbs.
      Your baby is as big as a pumpkin. So week 40’s come and gone. That’s frustrating
      (to put it mildly) but it’s certainly not unusual. Lots of pregnancies last
      into week 41 or even 42. Truth is, fewer than 5 percent of babies are born on
      their due date and about half of all babies don’t make their debut until well
      into the tenth month.But babies can overstay their womb welcome — after 42 weeks
      they are considered postmature. What does that mean? It means a baby’s skin
      may be temporarily dry, cracked, peeling, loose, or wrinkled because the protective
      cheesy vernix was shed weeks ago. He may have longer finger and toe nails and
      longer hair. He’ll have none of the fuzzy lanugo coating and he may be born
      more alert (he is older and wiser after all!).Because being postmature could
      also mean that the placenta is functioning less well and levels of amniotic
      fluid are dropping, you’ll be closely monitored to make sure Hotel Uterus is
      still a welcoming place for your guest. Any indication that it’s not hospitable
      anymore, and your practitioner will likely recommend labor induction. One thing’s
      for sure — that sweet little bundle of baby is coming any day now.
  utter_week_42:
  - text: During week 42 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 19 - 22 in, 7 - 9 lbs.
      Your baby is as big as a watermelon. You are almost there. Keep hanging on.
  utter_week_5:
  - text: During week 5 of your pregnancy, your baby weights Baby's super tiny. Your
      baby is as big as an orange seed. Welcome to week five of your pregnancy, the
      beginning of your second month (hey - only seven more to go!). Your pregnancy
      is still new, but that embryo inside of you is growing fast and furious… from
      the size of a poppy seed last week to as big as an orange seed right now — around
      one-twentieth of an inch long. Still pretty small, but a lot bigger than it’s
      been…and getting bigger every day!Wondering what your growing baby looks like
      now? Not much like a baby. Your little one has elongated from a ball of cells
      to a teeny tadpole-like shape, with a distinguishable head and, believe it or
      not, a tail. Not to worry, though. That tail will disappear soon enough, and
      a cute little baby bottom will take its place.This week a primitive heart begins
      to form and beat, pumping blood through your embryo’s emerging shape. The heart
      comes first because blood flow is essential. Without that blood flow, organs
      and the digestive and nervous systems won’t be able to form. At this early stage
      the design of the micro heart is still pretty rustic, with only two tubes pumping
      to a really unrhythmic rythym. The heart won’t be fully functional until those
      tubes fuse together and the heartbeats coordinate — activity that requires a
      brain!Fortunately, your baby’s brain is well past the blueprint phase. The neural
      tube, which will ultimately become baby’s spinal cord and brain, is under construction.
      And if that’s not enough body building going on, a rudimentary digestive system
      is taking shape, too. There’s a tube extending from the mouth to the tail of
      the embryo… and this tube will eventually turn into the stomach, liver, pancreas,
      and intestines.
  utter_week_6:
  - text: During week 6 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 0.2 - 0.25 in. Your baby
      is as big as a sweet pea. It’s week six and your little sweet pea is the size
      of…a sweet pea. Still tadpole (or prawn) shaped, that baby shrimp won’t be a
      shrimp much longer…in fact, he or she is growing quickly, measuring one-sixth
      of an inch from crown to rump this week.Why do we measure from head to tail?
      Right now, your baby’s body is curved over into a C-shape, and eventually, when
      those tiny legs start to form, your little one’s knees will be bent and tucked
      up under the chin. And that makes it tough to measure the head to toe length
      of the body. Instead, doctors measure from cute crown to just-as-cute rump until
      baby hits the 27-week mark, when a head-to-toe measurement takes over.Incredibly,
      your baby is starting to gain those features that hint at the adorable little
      one to come — you know, human stuff like a head and the beginnings of the facial
      features you’ll soon cover with kisses — the mouth, eyes, jaw, and chin. See
      those little indentations where you think those pinchable cheeks will be? Nope,
      those aren't dimples — they’re ear buds.Talking about budding buds, check out
      the limb buds that are starting to sprout from the trunk. They’ll grow into
      arms and legs. And very soon, nodules will develop at the ends of these limb
      buds and eventually become small hands and tiny feet.And that’s just what’s
      happening on the outside. There’s plenty of activity on the inside as well.
      Major organs are taking shape, including the kidneys, liver, and lungs. And
      that brand new heart is already beating an impressive 80 to 100 times per minute,
      a rate that’s rising every day.Fueling all this growth is the yolk sac — a balloon-like
      structure attached to the embryo. But the early placenta — known as the chorionic
      villi — has started to develop and form blood vessels, gearing up to take over
      and bring nutrition to the fetus when the yolk sac disappears by the end of
      the first trimester.
  utter_week_7:
  - text: During week 7 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 0.25 in. Your baby is
      as big as a blueberry. Things are full speed ahead inside your still-flat tummy.
      It’s only been five weeks since conception but your embryo is 10,000 times bigger
      now than it was when it arrived in your uterus. Of course it’s still pretty
      small — around a quarter of an inch or the size of a blueberry.Happily, that
      reptilian tail has all but vanished by now and your little cutie is starting
      to look a little cuter — with dark spots that’ll become eyes, two holes that
      will turn into nostrils, the beginnings of lips and, believe it or not, the
      early beginnings of tooth buds. But it’s the brain that’s getting all the attention
      now. Baby’s noggin wins the prize for biggest growth spurt this week as that
      busy brain-cell factory cranks out 100 cells per minute.Your little sprout is
      sprouting in other places, too. The limb buds are elongating and will soon become
      defined shoulders, arms, legs, and knees gearing up to kick you within another
      month or two. The little paddles at the ends are becoming more distinct and
      will soon develop into ten kissable fingers and ten kissable toes.Baby’s liver
      is in the early stages of formation and will soon begin producing red blood
      cells. And hot off the production line are baby’s permanent kidneys that are
      standing by, ready to produce pee in the next few weeks. No need for diapers
      just yet, though. The embryo’s urine flow will become part of the amniotic fluid
      it ingests and excretes continuously over the next seven months.
  utter_week_8:
  - text: During week 8 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 0.5 in. Your baby is
      as big as a raspberry. Grow, grow, grow — that’s what your baby’s doing round
      the clock at a pretty spectacular rate. By week eight your baby measures just
      over half an inch long and has grown from blueberry-size to the size of a big
      juicy raspberry. Much of baby’s bulk is taken up by its big head, where all
      that brain building activity is going on. Nerve cells are multiplying and connecting
      with each other — the beginnings of a neural network that will later transmit
      messages from brain to body.But it’s not just the brain that’s bulking up. Growth
      spurts are happening all over baby’s body now. One place you’ll notice a big
      change is the arms and legs. Those limbs are getting longer and stronger thanks
      to newly developing cartilage and bones. Joint formation is also on the agenda
      this week, which means shoulders, elbows, and knees are just around the bend.Fortunately,
      your baby’s tadpole tail isn't part of these growth spurts. It’s completely
      gone now and your embryo finally looks less reptilian and more human. He’s got
      the beginnings of a neck, the upper lip is forming, and there’s the sweet suggestion
      of a button nose. Tiny eyelids cover tiny eyes, and fingers and toes are developing,
      though they’re still webbed.Your baby’s umbilical cord is visible now, and the
      intestines are starting to develop inside it. Don’t worry — those intestines
      will migrate into baby’s belly soon enough. Baby’s heart has divided into the
      right and left chambers and is beating around 150 beats per minute now. That’s
      more than twice the rate of yours!It’s not just baby who’s getting bigger by
      the day. His cozy quarters are getting bigger, too. Your amniotic fluid increases
      by about two tablespoons a week so your roomie’s got room to move and keep on
      growing. It won’t be long before your bigger-by-the-minute baby and uterus start
      making your bump look bigger by the minute, too.
  utter_week_9:
  - text: During week 9 of your pregnancy, your baby weights 1 in. Your baby is as
      big as a green olive. Your baby’s not quite ready for a cap and gown, but this
      week it’s graduation time as your little one graduates from her embryonic stage
      and officially enters the fetal period. At about an inch long, the graduate
      is the size of a medium green cocktail olive (but please…hold the martini!)Baby’s
      heart is now both developed and large enough to be picked up by ultrasound.
      But if your practitioner can’t detect the thump-thump of that little ticker
      this week, don’t worry. It probably means your tiny target is hiding out in
      a far corner of your uterus or facing away from the sensor. Sometime in the
      next few weeks you’ll get a listen for sure.Your little body builder can boast
      the groundbreaking of some new organs this week such as the liver, the spleen
      and the gallbladder are all under construction now. The bladder and urethra
      separate from the developing digestive tract and the intestines begin to move
      out of the umbilical cord and into the abdominal cavity, which has grown big
      enough to house them.The diaphragm starts to form — it’s the muscular membrane
      that will separate the chest and abdomen… plus help your cutie breathe after
      she’s born. And though you won’t feel it yet, your baby is trying out some early
      moves. Tiny muscles are starting to develop, allowing your little dancer to
      make spontaneous reflex movements with those tiny arms and legs.
