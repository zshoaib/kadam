For many women, this starts around the sixth or eighth week after conception. Although this could be caused by a urinary tract infection, diabetes, or overusing diuretics, if you're pregnant, it's most likely due to hormonal levels. Constipation. During pregnancy, higher levels of the hormone progesterone can make you constipated. Progesterone causes food to pass more slowly through your intestines. To ease the problem, drink plenty of water, exercise, and eat plenty of high-fiber foods. Mood swings. These are common, especially during the first trimester. These are also related to changes in hormones. Headaches and back pain. Many pregnant women report frequent mild headaches, and others experience chronic back pain. Dizziness and fainting.

    "response": "One first semester genetic test that combines a blood test with an ultrasound to screen for Down syndrome may be available between 11 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. The results of a blood test that measures hCG and/or PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A) in maternal blood are used with an ultrasound measurement of the skin at the back of the fetus’ neck (called nuchal translucency). The procedure may be able to pick up a substantial portion of Down syndrome cases and other genetic conditions. But with all screening methods, a more invasive diagnostic technique like chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is used if results are positive.Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) screening: This cell-free fetal DNA test can be done as early as after 10 weeks of pregnancy. The test uses a blood sample to measure the relative amount of free fetal DNA in a mother's blood. It's thought that the test can detect 99% of all Down syndrome pregnancies. It also tests for some other chromosomal abnormalities.Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): If you're 35 or older, have a family history of certain diseases, or have had a positive result on non-invasive genetic tests, you will be offered this optional, invasive test usually between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. CVS can detect many genetic defects, such as Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy. The procedure involves either threading a tiny catheter through your cervix or inserting a needle into your abdomen to obtain a tissue sample from the placenta. The procedure carries a 1% risk of inducing miscarriage and is about 98% accurate in ruling out certain chromosomal birth defects. But unlike amniocentesis, it does not help in detecting neural tube disorders, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, or abdominal wall defects.Talk to your doctor about all of your testing options. Together you can decide on the ones best for you."

    "question": "What are the risks of inducing labor?",
    "response": "Generally, inducing labor is safe, but there are risks:Higher risk of a C-section. If induction doesn't work, your doctor might decide to switch to a C-section instead.Longer hospital stay. If you're induced, you may be in the hospital longer during labor and delivery. If you wind up needing a C-section after induction, your time in the hospital will be even longer.Increased need for pain medicine. Inducing labor might cause contractions to come on stronger and more often than they would naturally. You're more likely to need an epidural or another medicine to manage the pain.Increased risk of infection. Breaking the amniotic sac can lead to infection if you don't deliver within a day or two after induction.Complications during delivery. Induction, especially with medications, might not be safe for women who’ve had a previous C-section or other surgery to the uterus. They have a higher risk of uterine rupture. Intense contractions also cause the placenta to detach from the wall of the uterus, called placental abruption. Both of these conditions are serious but rare, even with induction."

The FDA has guidelines for drug companies to follow in labeling medications about their effect on pregnancy and the growing fetus. By reading the product information, you can learn more about how the medication may affect your pregnancy.The FDA requires drug companies to conduct special studies called pregnancy registries. Women who take a certain medication may enroll in the study. After delivery, their babies are compared to babies of moms who didn't take the medication during pregnancy. When the data is compiled, these studies can help agencies monitor the effects of medications after they are made available.Some women must take drugs during pregnancy. They may need to take them for pain or for a serious condition such as asthma, epilepsy, hypertension or depression.

  },
  {
    "question": "What is umbilical cord compression?",
    "response": "Sometimes the umbilical cord gets stretched and compressed during labor, leading to a brief decrease in blood flow to the fetus. This can cause sudden, short drops in fetal heart rate, called variable decelerations, which are usually picked up by monitors during labor. Cord compression happens in about one in 10 deliveries. In most cases, these heart rate changes aren't a major deal and the birth happens normally. But a C-section may be necessary if the baby's heart rate worsens or the baby shows other signs of distress."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does my body change during ovulation?",
    "response": "Your hormone levels change throughout your menstrual cycle. During the first half, your ovaries give off the hormone estrogen. When your estrogen levels get high enough, your ovary releases an egg. Then, your body starts to make progesterone, another hormone. It causes your body temperature to rise slightly.Track your temperature every day before you get out of bed. This reading is known as your basal body temperature. If you keep tabs over a few months, you may notice a pattern that shows when you ovulate. That will help you plot your fertile window.Your hormones also change the texture of your cervical mucus, the sticky fluid that comes from your cervix, the bottom of your uterus. As your body gets ready to ovulate, you have more of it, and it feels more stretchy and slippery, like raw egg whites. The texture helps sperm swim inside your body. When your mucus feels like this, you should be in your fertile window."

If this was done, or the area was torn during birth, the stitches may make walking or sitting difficult. Sore breasts. Your breasts may be swollen, hard, and painful for several days as your milk comes in.  Hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids (swollen varicose veins in the anal area) are common after pregnancy and delivery.Constipation. Having a bowel movement may be difficult for a few days after delivery. Hemorrhoids, episiotomies, and sore muscles can cause pain with bowel movements. Hot and cold flashes. Your body's adjustment to changing levels of hormones and blood flow can cause you to perspire one minute and reach for a blanket to cover yourself the next. Urinary or fecal incontinence. Muscles stretched during delivery, particularly after a long labor, may cause you to leak urine when you laugh or sneeze or may make it difficult to control bowel movements, causing accidental bowel leakage. \"After pains.\" After giving birth, you will continue to experience contractions for a few days as your uterus returns to its pre-pregnancy size. You may notice contractions most while your baby is nursing. Vaginal discharge (lochia). Immediately following birth you will experience a bloody discharge heavier than a regular period.

Taking folic acid adds an important level of protection for older women, who have a higher risk of having a baby with birth defects. Some prenatal vitamins have 800-1,000 mcg of folic acid. This is still safe in pregnancy. As a matter of fact, some women need more than 400 mcg for protection against birth defects. Do not take more than 1,000 mcg (1 milligram) of folic acid without asking your doctor. Women with a history of a child with neural tube defects need 4,000 mcg."

    "question": "How can a previous C-section scar affect my chances of getting a vaginal birth after c-section (VBAC)?",
    "response": "A vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC) is possible for many women, but there are factors to help you and your doctor decide if it’s right for you.One crucial factor is the type of C-section scar that you have on your uterus. (This may be the same type of scar that you have on your abdomen, but it may go in a different direction.) Doctors make incisions (cuts in the abdomen and uterus) in two different directions during a C-section:A vertical cut goes from top to bottom. You can’t attempt VBAC because of the high chance that your scar would open or tear.A transverse cut goes from side to side. Your doctor may allow you to try a vaginal birth if you and your baby are healthy and your other risk factors are low."
  },
  {
    "question": "When do you get electronic fetal heart monitoring during pregnancy?",

  {
    "question": "Are congestion and nosebleeds normal during the second trimester of pregnancy?",
    "response": "Hormonal changes cause the mucus membranes lining your nose to swell, which can lead to a stuffy nose and make you snore at night. These changes may also make your nose bleed more easily. Before using a decongestant, check with your doctor. Saline drops and other natural methods may be safer ways to clear congestion during pregnancy. You can also try using a humidifier to keep the air moist. To stop a nosebleed, keep your head up straight (don't tilt it back) and apply pressure to the nostril for a few minutes until the bleeding stops."

  {
    "question": "What is amniocentesis?",
    "response": "Amniocentesis is a prenatal test in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is removed from the sac surrounding the fetus for testing. The sample of amniotic fluid (less than one ounce) is removed through a fine needle inserted into the uterus through the abdomen, under ultrasound guidance. The fluid is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Different tests can be performed on a sample of amniotic fluid, depending on the genetic risk and reason for the test."

    "question": "Which side should you sleep on when you're pregnant?",
    "response": "Some doctors recommend that pregnant women lie on their left side in the third trimester to allow for the best blood flow to the fetus, uterus and kidneys. Because your liver is on the right side of your body, lying on the left side also helps keep the uterus from pressing on that large organ."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are you more likely to get sore throats when pregnant?",
    "response": "You may get more illnesses when you're pregnant because you're more susceptible to infection, such as viruses. Your immune system lowers slightly during pregnancy so your body won't reject your developing baby. Not all sore throats are due to infection, however. For example, heartburn, a common pregnancy symptom, can also give you a sore throat. Pregnant women also often become congested, which can lead to a sore throat. Fortunately, simple home treatments ease most sore throats."

  {
    "question": "What are the effects of cigarette smoking during pregnancy?",
    "response": "Cigarette smoking causes serious illness and premature death in the general population, but pregnant women who smoke pass the nicotine and other carcinogenic chemicals to the growing fetus. According to the Centers for Disease Control, mothers who smoke early in their pregnancies are more likely to deliver babies that have several different heart defects, including septal defects - essentially a hole in the wall between the heart’s left and right chambers. Sadly, most infants with congenital heart defects die in the first year of life. Those infants who survive often face lengthy hospital stays and numerous surgeries along with a lifetime of disabilities.Women who smoke are also more likely to have placenta problems. This is a serious concern because the placenta provides nourishment to the baby in the womb. Smokers also have low-birth-weight babies, premature deliveries, and babies with cleft palate. In addition, smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is one of the causes associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)."

    "question": "Can you change your cats litter box while pregnant?",
    "response": "Cats can carry a disease called toxoplasmosis that can harm a fetus and lead to birth defects. Your vet can test for it, but better still, follow some simple advice from the CDC when you're pregnant. Have someone else change the box -- and frequently -- because it is only after 1 to 5 days in the litter box that toxoplasmosis becomes infectious.You can also try to keep your cat indoors and avoid giving it raw meat to prevent it from being exposed to Toxoplasma infection. If you garden, wear gloves and wash hands well. The soil can contain organisms from cat feces."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent preeclampsia?",
    "response": "You can't prevent preeclampsia, but researchers are trying to determine if it's possible to. One study shows that eating food bars containing the amino acid L-arginine and antioxidant vitamins lowers the chance of preeclampsia in high-risk women. Another study shows that overweight or obese women who gained fewer than 15 pounds during pregnancy had a lower risk for preeclampsia. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor before making any changes."

  {
    "question": "How can weighing too much or too little affect your chances of getting pregnant?",
    "response": "Weighing too much or too little lowers your chances of becoming pregnant. Either can cause irregular menstrual cycles. When you don't have a period every month, your ovaries won't release an egg, or ovulate. When this doesn't happen, you can't make a baby.Sometimes, weight changes cause swings in hormone levels that lead to infertility. Your goal is to have a healthy weight before and during pregnancy.

    "question": "What does heartburn during your first trimester of pregnancy mean?",
    "response": "During pregnancy, your body produces more of the progesterone hormone which relaxes smooth muscles -- including the ring of muscle in your lower esophagus that normally keeps food and acids down in your stomach. This muscle relaxation can lead to acid reflux, otherwise known as heartburn. To avoid the burn, eat frequent, smaller meals throughout the day; don't lie down right after eating; and avoid greasy, spicy, and acidic foods (like citrus fruits). You can also try raising your pillows when you sleep."

    "question": "Is pregnancy massage safe?",
    "response": "Some doctors hesitate to advise massage during pregnancy because there is a huge variation in training. There is also a lack of certification standards nationwide. This is especially true for the specialty of pregnancy massage. Not all states have laws requiring a set minimum training for a massage therapist, regardless of whether or not the therapist's client is pregnant.Also, like many forms of complementary medicine, massage therapy during pregnancy hasn't been rigorously studied with high-quality clinical research methods. One area of controversy is whether it's safe to have a massage during the first trimester.Many massage therapists won't give pregnancy massages during the first trimester. The reason is the potential for miscarriage. Some pregnancy massage experts argue that pregnancy massage doesn't, in itself, cause miscarriage, but no research has been done to show a link between a massage and a miscarriage. Because many miscarriages happen in the first trimester, some massage therapists and doctors counsel against first-trimester massage simply to avoid any potential liability issues should a miscarriage occur.The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine advises all pregnant women to consult with their doctor before trying massage."
